The endemic status of goose parvovirus (GPV) continues to devastate the poultry 
industry in China. Novel GPV (NGPV) and Mutated GPV (MGPV) represent the 
predominant lineages. However, the comparative pathogenicity between these 
viruses remains poorly understood. Herein, we selected representative NGPV and 
MGPV strains as model viruses to assess their pathogenic potential both in vitro 
and in vivo. In vitro cellular and embryo assays demonstrated that both NGPV and 
MGPV were capable of replicating in DEF and GEF cells, leading to pronounced 
cytopathic effects. However, these viruses exhibited distinct levels of 
intra-embryonic replication capabilities. Furthermore, we conducted in vivo 
infection experiments and systematically evaluated the pathogenic differences 
between NGPV and MGPV by examining various indicators, including growth, 
clinical signs, gross pathology, skeletal development, viral load, and humoral 
response in the infected animals. The results showed that both NGPV and MGPV 
inhibited weight gain in goslings and ducklings, with NGPV exerting a more 
significant suppressive impact. MGPV induced classical gosling plague pathology 
in goslings, while NGPV led to short beak and dwarfism syndrome in ducklings, 
notably disrupting skeletal development. Moreover, MGPV and NGPV exhibited 
diverse host tropisms, with MGPV being more pathogenic to goslings and NGPV to 
ducklings. Both viruses elicited specific antibody responses, with MGPV being 
more effective in goslings and NGPV in ducklings. Additionally, MGPV exhibited 
stronger humoral response compared to NGPV. These findings enhance our 
understanding of the pathogenicity of prevalent GPV strains in waterfowl, 
offering a critical theoretical foundation for devising strategies to prevent 
GPV infections.

BACKGROUND: The accurate and early evaluation of response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is crucial for optimizing treatment 
strategies and minimizing unnecessary interventions. While deep learning 
(DL)-based approaches have shown promise in medical imaging analysis, existing 
models often fail to comprehensively integrate spatial and temporal tumor 
dynamics. This study aims to develop and validate a spatiotemporal interaction 
(STI) model based on longitudinal MRI data to predict pathological complete 
response (pCR) to NAC in breast cancer patients.
METHODS: This study included retrospective and prospective datasets from five 
medical centers in China, collected from June 2018 to December 2024. These 
datasets were assigned to the primary cohort (including training and internal 
validation sets), external validation cohorts, and a prospective validation 
cohort. DCE-MRI scans from both pre-NAC (T0) and early-NAC (T1) stages were 
collected for each patient, along with surgical pathology results. A Siamese 
network-based STI model was developed, integrating spatial features from tumor 
segmentation with temporal dependencies using a transformer-based multi-head 
attention mechanism. This model was designed to simultaneously capture spatial 
heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of NAC 
response. The STI model's performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) and Precision-Recall curve (AP), accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity. Additionally, the I-SPY1 and I-SPY2 datasets were used for 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and to explore the biological basis of the STI 
model, respectively. The prospective cohort was registered with Chinese Clinical 
Trial Registration Centre (ChiCTR2500102170).
FINDINGS: A total of 1044 patients were included in this study, with the pCR 
rate ranging from 23.8% to 35.9%. The STI model demonstrated good performance in 
early prediction of NAC response in breast cancer. In the external validation 
cohorts, the AUC values were 0.923 (95% CI: 0.859-0.987), 0.892 (95% CI: 
0.821-0.963), and 0.913 (95% CI: 0.835-0.991), all outperforming the 
single-timepoint T0 or T1 models, as well as models with spatial information 
added (all p < 0.05, Delong test). Additionally, the STI model significantly 
outperformed the clinical model (p < 0.05, Delong test) and radiologists' 
predictions. In the prospective validation cohort, the STI model identified 
90.2% (37/41) of non-pCR and 82.6% (19/23) of pCR patients, reducing 
misclassification rates by 58.7% and 63.3% compared to radiologists. This 
indicates that these patients might benefit from treatment adjustment or 
continued therapy in the early NAC stage. Survival analysis showed a significant 
correlation between the STI model and both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and 
overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients. Further investigation revealed 
that favorable NAC responses predicted by the STI model were closely linked to 
upregulated immune-related genes and enhanced immune cell infiltration.
INTERPRETATION: Our study established a novel noninvasive STI model that 
integrates the spatiotemporal evolution of MRI before and during NAC to achieve 
early and accurate pCR prediction, offering potential guidance for personalized 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Early and precise diagnosis is vital to improving patient outcomes 
and reducing morbidity. In resource-limited settings, cancer diagnosis is often 
challenging due to shortages of expert pathologists. We assess the effectiveness 
of general-purpose pathology foundation models (FM) for the diagnosis and 
annotation of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in resource-limited settings.
METHODS: We evaluated three pathology FMs (UNI, PRISM, and Prov-GigaPath) using 
deidentified NMSC histology images from the Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium 
Trial to predict cancer subtype based on zero-shot whole-slide embeddings. In 
addition, we evaluated tile aggregation methods and machine learning models for 
prediction. Lastly, we employed few-shot learning of PRISM tile embeddings to 
perform whole-slide annotation.
RESULTS: We found that the best model used PRISM's aggregated tile embeddings to 
train a multilayer perceptron model to predict NMSC subtype [mean area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.925, P < 0.001]. Within the 
other FMs, we found that using attention-based multi-instance learning to 
aggregate tile embeddings to train a multilayer perceptron model was optimal 
(UNI: mean AUROC = 0.913, P < 0.001; Prov-GigaPath: mean AUROC = 0.908, P < 
0.001). We finally exemplify the utility of few-shot annotation in computation- 
and expertise-limited settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the important role FMs may play in confronting 
public health challenges and exhibits a real-world potential for machine 
learning-aided cancer diagnosis.
IMPACT: Pathology FMs offer a promising pathway to improve early and precise 
NMSC diagnosis, especially in resource-limited environments. These tools could 
also facilitate patient stratification and recruitment for prospective clinical 
trials aimed at improving NMSC management.

BACKGROUND: Comprehensive lipidomic studies have demonstrated strong 
cross-sectional associations between the blood lipidome and late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and its risk factors, yet the longitudinal 
relationship between lipidome changes and AD progression remains unclear.
METHODS: We employed longitudinal lipidomic profiling on 4730 plasma samples 
from 1517 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
cohort to investigate the temporal evolution of lipidomes among diagnostic 
groups. At baseline (n = 1393), participants were classified as stable diagnosis 
status including stable AD (n = 243), stable cognitive normal (CN; n = 337), and 
stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 413), or converters (AD converters: n 
= 329; MCI converters: n = 71). We developed a dementia risk classification 
model to stratify the non-converting MCI group into dementia-like and 
non-dementia-like MCI based on their baseline lipidomic profiles, aiming to 
identify early metabolic signatures predictive of dementia progression.
FINDINGS: Longitudinal analysis identified significant associations between the 
change in ether lipid species (including alkylphosphatidylcholine, 
alkenylphosphatidylcholine, lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine, and 
lysoalkenylphosphatidylcholine) and AD dementia conversion. Specifically, AD 
dementia converters show a 3-4.8% reduction in these ether lipid species 
compared to the non-converting CN and MCI groups, suggesting metabolic 
dysregulation as a key feature of AD progression. Further, The Dementia Risk 
Model effectively distinguished MCI from AD dementia converters (AUC = 0.70; 95% 
CI: 0.66-0.74). Within the MCI group, the model identified a high-risk subgroup 
with a twofold higher likelihood of conversion to AD dementia compared to the 
low-risk group. External validation in the ASPREE cohort confirmed its 
predictive utility, with the Dementia Risk Score discriminating incident 
dementia from cognitively normal individuals (C-index = 0.75, 95% CI: 
0.73-0.78), improving prediction by 2% over the combination of traditional risk 
factors and APOE genetic risk factor. Additionally, the Dementia Risk Score was 
significantly associated with reduced temporal lobar fludeoxyglucose uptake (Î² = 
-0.286, p = 1.34 Ã 10-4), higher amyloid PET levels (Î² = 0.308, p = 4.03 Ã 
10-4), and elevated p-tau levels (Î² = 0.167, p = 2.37 Ã 10-2), reinforcing its 
pathophysiological relevance in tracking neurodegeneration, amyloid burden, and 
tau pathology.
INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight lipidomic profiling as a potential 
blood-based biomarker for identifying individuals at high risk of AD 
progression, offering a scalable, non-invasive approach for early detection, 
risk stratification, and targeted interventions in AD.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low- 
and middle-income countries. Traditional microscopy-based diagnostics are 
labor-intensive and error-prone, while automated deep learning models often 
require detailed expert annotations and intensive preprocessing, limiting their 
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised 
approach for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in microscopy images, 
leveraging UNI, a foundation model pretrained on millions of pathology images. 
Our method encodes microscopy images as sequences of patch-level embeddings 
using UNI and applies a Transformer encoder to classify each image using only 
image-level labels, without requiring detailed annotations. This framework 
minimizes preprocessing, reduces annotation costs, and enhances scalability. Our 
model was trained and tested on large, diverse datasets, achieving high PR-AUC 
scores (0.943-0.974), demonstrating strong performance and robustness. This 
success highlights the potential of our approach, which introduces two key 
innovations not previously explored for automated TB detection: leveraging 
cross-domain transfer learning by applying UNI for MTB detection and using a 
weakly supervised approach that relies only on image-level labels, significantly 
reducing the annotation burden compared to traditional fully supervised methods. 
Our results underscore the feasibility of foundation models in TB diagnostics 
and broader medical imaging applications. This scalable, weakly supervised 
approach demonstrates promising experimental results, highlighting its potential 
to significantly reduce annotation requirements and streamline TB detection 
workflows, particularly relevant to resource-limited settings.

BACKGROUND: Cellular imaging analysis using the traditional retrospective 
approach is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although AI-based 
solutions are available, these approaches rely heavily on supervised learning 
techniques that require high quality, large labeled datasets from the same 
microscope to be reliable. In addition, primary patient samples are often 
heterogeneous cell populations and need to be stained to distinguish the 
cellular subsets. The resulting imaging data is analyzed and labeled manually by 
experts. Therefore, a method to distinguish cell populations across imaging 
devices without the need for staining and extensive manual labeling would help 
immensely to gain real-time insights into cell population dynamics. This 
especially holds true for recognizing specific cell types and states in response 
to treatments.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop an unsupervised approach using general vision 
foundation models trained on diverse and extensive imaging datasets to extract 
rich visual features for cell-analysis across devices, including both stained 
and unstained live cells. Our method, Entropy-guided Weighted Combinational 
FAISS (EWC-FAISS), uses these models purely in an inference-only mode without 
task-specific retraining on the cellular data. Combining the generated 
embeddings in an efficient and adaptive k-nearest neighbor search allows for 
automated, cross device identification of cell types and states, providing a 
strong basis for AI-assisted cancer therapy.
METHODS: We utilized two publicly available datasets. The WBC dataset includes 
14,424 images of stained white blood cell samples from patients with acute 
myeloid and lymphoid leukemia, as well as those without leukemic pathology. The 
LISC dataset comprises 257 images of white blood cell samples from healthy 
individuals. We generated four in-house datasets utilizing the JIMT-1 breast 
cancer cell line, as well as Jurkat and K562 (leukemic cell lines). These 
datasets were acquired using the Nanolive 3D Cell Explorer-fluo (CX-A) 
holotomographic microscope and the BioTek Lionheart FX automated brightfield 
microscope. The images from the in-house datasets were manually annotated using 
Roboflow software. To generate the embeddings, we used and optimized a 
concatenated combination of SAM, DINO, ConvNeXT, SWIN, CLIP and ViTMAE. The 
combined embeddings were used as input for the adaptive k-nearest neighbor 
search, building an approximate Hierarchical Navigable Small World FAISS index. 
We compared EWC-FAISS to fully fined-tuned ViT-Classifiers with DINO-, and 
SWIN-backbones, a ConvNeXT architecture, as well as to NMTune as a lightweight 
domain-adaptation method with frozen backbone.
RESULTS: EWC-FAISS performed competitively with the baselines on the original 
datasets in terms of macro accuracy. Macro accuracy is the average of 
class-specific accuracies, treating all classes equally by averaging their 
individual accuracies. EWC-FAISS ranked second for the WBC dataset (macro 
accuracy: 97.6 Â± 0.2), first for cell state classification from Nanolive (macro 
accuracy: 90 Â± 0), and performed comparably for cell type classification from 
Lionheart (macro accuracy: 87 Â± 0). For the transfer to out-of-distribution 
(OOD) datasets, which the model had not seen during training, EWC-FAISS 
consistently outperformed the other baselines. For the LISC dataset, EWC-FAISS 
achieved a macro accuracy of 78.5 Â± 0.3, compared to DINO FT's 17 Â± 1, SWIN FT's 
44 Â± 14, ConvNeXT FT's 45 Â± 9, and NMTune's 52 Â± 10. For the cell state 
classification from Lionheart, EWC-FAISS had a macro accuracy of 86 Â± 1, while 
DINO FT, SWIN FT, and ConvNeXT FT achieved 65 Â± 11, 68 Â± 16, and 81 Â± 1, 
respectively, and NMTune 81 Â± 7. For the transfer of cell type classification 
from Nanolive, EWC-FAISS attained a macro accuracy of 85 Â± 0, compared to DINO 
FT's 24.5 Â± 0.9, SWIN FT's 57 Â± 6, ConvNeXT FT's 54 Â± 4, and NMTune's 63 Â± 4. 
Additionally, building EWC-FAISS after embedding generation was significantly 
faster than training DINO FT (â¼ 6 minutes compared to > 10 hours). Lastly, 
EWC-FAISS performed comparably in distinguishing cancerous cell lines from 
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells with a mean accuracy of 80 Â± 5, compared to 
CellMixer with a mean accuracy of 79.7.
CONCLUSION: We present a novel approach to identify various cell lines and 
primary cells based on their identity and state using images acquired across 
various imaging platforms which vary in resolution, magnification and image 
quality. Despite these differences, we could show that our efficient, adaptive 
k-nearest neighbor search pipeline can be applied on a large image dataset 
containing different cell types and effectively differentiate between the cells 
and their states such as live, apoptotic or necrotic. There are several 
applications, particularly in distinguishing various cell populations in patient 
samples or monitoring therapy.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy in women 
globally, representing 11.7% of all new cancer cases (2.3 million annually) and 
causing approximately 685,000 deaths in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020). This 
multifactorial disease, influenced by genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors, 
often presents with nonspecific early symptoms that delay detection. While 
mammography, ultrasound and MRI serve as primary screening modalities, 
histopathological examination remains the diagnostic gold standard-though 
subject to interpretation variability. Recent advances in deep learning 
demonstrate promising potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce false 
positives/negatives, and alleviate radiologists' workload, thereby enhancing 
clinical decision-making in breast cancer management.
METHODS: This study trains and evaluates 14 deep learning models, including 
AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50, Densenet121, MobileNetV2, ResNeXt, 
RegNet, EfficientNet_B0, ConvNeXT, ViT, DINOV2, UNI, and GigaPath on the 
BreakHis v1 dataset. These models encompass both CNN-based and Transformer-based 
architectures. The study focuses on assessing their performance in breast cancer 
diagnosis using key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, specificity, recall 
(sensitivity), F1-score, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
RESULTS: In the binary classification task, due to its relatively low 
complexity, most models achieved excellent performance. Among them, CNN-based 
models such as ResNet50, RegNet, and ConvNeXT, as well as the Transformer-based 
foundation model UNI, all reached an AUC of 0.999. The best overall performance 
was achieved by ConvNeXT, which attained an accuracy of 99.2% (95% CI: 98.3%-1), 
a specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 99.1%-1), an F1-score of 99.1% (95% CI: 
98.0-1%), a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.983 (95% CI: 0.960-1), and an AUC of 
0.999 (95% CI: 0.999-1). In the eight-class classification task, the increased 
complexity led to more pronounced performance differences among models, with 
CNN- and Transformer-based architectures performing comparably overall. The 
best-performing model was the fine-tuned foundation model UNI, which attained an 
accuracy of 95.5% (95% CI: 94.4-96.6%), a specificity of 95.6% (95% CI: 
94.2-96.9%), an F1-score of 95.0% (95% CI: 93.9-96.1%), a Cohen's Kappa 
coefficient of 0.939 (95% CI: 0.926-0.952), and an AUC of 0.998 (95% CI: 
0.997-0.999). Additionally, using foundation model encoders directly without 
fine-tuning resulted in generally poor performance on the classification task.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that deep learning models are highly effective 
in classifying breast cancer pathology images, particularly in binary tasks 
where multiple models reach near-perfect performance. Although recent 
Transformer-based foundation models such as UNI possess strong feature 
extraction capabilities, their zero-shot performance on this specific task was 
limited. However, with simple fine-tuning, they quickly achieved excellent 
results. This indicates that with minimal adaptation, foundation models can be 
valuable tools in digital pathology, especially in complex multi-class 
scenarios.

PiRNAs are a subclass of non-coding RNAs, 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length, that 
form regulatory complexes through their interaction with PIWI proteins. Studies 
in model organisms have demonstrated that piRNAs play crucial roles in tissue 
development and in predicting disease outcomes, positioning them as promising 
targets for developmental regulation and therapeutic intervention. In contrast, 
research on piRNAs in animal husbandry is still in its early stages and has not 
received sufficient attention. Despite this, the few studies available in 
livestock research have revealed that piRNAs serve as key regulators of 
reproductive development, underscoring their significant regulatory potential in 
farm animals and justifying further investigation. Accordingly, this review uses 
the bovine mammary gland as an exemplary case to summarize the progress in piRNA 
research related to mammary development and disease. The role of piRNAs in 
regulating breast cancer stem cell proliferation and modulating inflammatory 
progression is a highly active area of research. We hypothesize that piRNAs may 
play a potential role in regulating both mammary gland development and mastitis, 
making them promising targets for enhancing mammary development and overall 
health in dairy cattle and providing a theoretical foundation for further piRNA 
applications in animal husbandry.

INTRODUCTION: Histological analysis of kidney biopsies is crucial in diagnosing 
kidney diseases and predicting clinical outcomes. Recently developed pathology 
foundation models, pretrained on large-scale pathology datasets, have 
demonstrated excellent performance in various downstream applications. This 
study evaluated the utility of pathology foundation models combined with 
multiple instance learning (MIL) for kidney pathology analysis.
METHODS: We used 242 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images 
(WSIs) from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and Japan-Pathology 
Artificial Intelligence Diagnostics Project (JP-AID) databases as the 
development cohort, comprising 47 healthy controls, 35 acute interstitial 
nephritis, and 160 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) slides. External validation was 
performed using 83 WSIs from the University of Tokyo Hospital (UT dataset). 
Diagnoses were based on adjudicated diagnoses (KPMP) or expert 
pathologists-derived diagnoses (JP-AID and UT). Pretrained pathology foundation 
models were utilized as patch encoders and compared with ImageNet-pretrained 
ResNet50.
RESULTS: In internal validation, all foundation models outperformed ResNet50, 
achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) over 
0.980. In external validation, the performance of ResNet50 markedly dropped 
(AUROC = 0.768), whereas all foundation models maintained higher performance 
(AUROC over 0.800). Visualization with attention heatmaps confirmed that 
foundation models accurately recognized diagnostically relevant structures. 
Additionally, foundation models outperformed ResNet50 in predicting severe 
proteinuria among DKD cases from KPMP dataset.
CONCLUSION: We successfully integrated pathology foundation models with MIL to 
achieve robust diagnostic performance, even when trained on a relatively small 
dataset, highlighting their potential for real-world clinical applications. Key 
words: artificial intelligence, renal pathology, foundation model, multiple 
instance learning.

Determining the mutation status of proto-oncogene B-Rapidly Accelerated 
Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) is crucial in melanoma for guiding targeted therapies and 
improving patient outcomes. While genetic testing has become more accessible, 
histopathological examination remains central to routine diagnostics, and an 
image-based strategy could further streamline the associated time and cost. In 
this study, we propose a new machine learning framework that integrates a 
large-scale, pretrained foundation model (Prov-GigaPath) with a 
gradient-boosting classifier (XGBoost) to predict BRAF-V600 mutation status 
directly from histopathological slides. Our approach was trained and 
cross-validated on the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) dataset from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA; 275 slides), where the fine-tuned Prov-GigaPath model alone 
achieved an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.653 during cross-validation. 
An additional test on 68 slides from the University Hospital Essen (UHE), 
Germany, yielded an AUC of 0.697 (95â¯% CI: 0.553-0.821). Incorporating XGBoost 
significantly improved performance, reaching an AUC of 0.824 (SD=0.043) during 
cross-validation and 0.772 (95â¯% CI: 0.650-0.886) on the independent 
set-representing a new state-of-the-art for image-only BRAF mutation prediction 
in melanoma. By employing a weakly supervised, data-efficient pipeline, this 
method reduces the need for extensive annotations and costly molecular assays. 
While these results are not intended to replace genetic testing at this stage, 
they mark a new milestone in predicting BRAF mutation status solely from 
histopathological slides-a concept not yet fully established in prior 
research-and underscore the potential for seamlessly integrating automated, 
AI-driven decision-support tools into diagnostic workflows, thereby expediting 
personalized therapy decisions and advancing precision oncology.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) constitutes a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease, 
and effective treatment of RA remains a challenge. Due to the multiple side 
effects and "therapeutic ceiling" effect of current RA medications, it is 
essential to find natural alternatives and explore their mechanisms of action in 
RA. In this study, we analyzed the targets of action and signaling pathways of 
gentiopicroside (GEN) in RA using network pharmacology and validated them 
through molecular docking and experimental approaches. A collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) rat model was employed to analyze the role of GEN in influencing 
RA joint pathology and related angiogenic factors. Additionally, cellular 
experiments were conducted to assess the proliferation, migration, and tubular 
structure formation ability of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Western 
blotting was used to detect the protein expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4. Network 
pharmacological analyses revealed that GEN exerts multiple effects on RA therapy 
by modulating multiple pathways. Combined with literature analysis and molecular 
docking data modeling, GEN was found to intervene in RA by regulating CXCL12 and 
CXCR4. In CIA rats, GEN inhibited the expression of HIF-1Î±, CXCL12, VEGF-A, and 
Ang-2, and attenuated the pathology associated with aberrant neovascularization 
in the knee joint. Cellular experiments confirmed that GEN could inhibit the 
proliferation, migration, and tubular structure formation ability of EPCs 
induced by high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and could inhibit the formation of 
abnormal neovascularization by interfering with CXCL12 and CXCR4. GEN 
demonstrates a significant effect in inhibiting abnormal neovascularization and 
can regulate CXCL12 and CXCR4 to intervene in the pathological progression of 
RA. This study provides a novel approach for the treatment of RA and a 
theoretical foundation for further research.

The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing 
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised 
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology 
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative 
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a 
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve 
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling 
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, 
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based 
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, 
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H&E-stained whole slide images 
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a 
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without 
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across 
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train 
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between 
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case 
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely 
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be 
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell 
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, 
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to 
use H&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we 
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H&E images. Our trained models 
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

BACKGROUND: Effective prognostication improves selection of patients with 
prostate cancer for treatment combinations. We aimed to evaluate whether a 
previously developed multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI) algorithm was 
prognostic in very advanced prostate cancer using data from four phase 3 trials 
of the STAMPEDE platform protocol.
METHODS: We included patients starting androgen-deprivation therapy in the 
docetaxel, docetaxel plus zoledronic acid, abiraterone, or abiraterone plus 
enzalutamide trials. Patients were recruited at 112 sites. We combined all 
standard-of-care control patients (including those allocated to standard of care 
[SOC-ADT] consisting of testosterone suppression with luteinising 
hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, and radiotherapy when 
indicated), and we combined the rest of the patients into docetaxel-treated or 
abiraterone-treated groups. Patients had either metastatic disease or were at 
very high-risk of metastatic disease, determined by node-positivity or, if 
node-negative, by T stage, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and 
Gleason score. We used the locked ArteraAI Prostate MMAI algorithm that combined 
these clinical variables, age, and digitised prostate biopsy pathology images. 
We performed Fine-Gray and Cox regression adjusted for treatment allocation and 
cumulative incidence analyses at 5 years to evaluate associations with prostate 
cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) for continuous (per SD increase) and 
categorical (quartile-Q) scores. The STAMPEDEâplatform protocol is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00268476.
FINDINGS: Of 5213 eligible patients recruited from Oct 5, 2005, to March 31, 
2016, 3167 were included in this analysis (1575 [49Â·7%] with non-metastatic 
disease, 1592 [50Â·3%] with metastatic disease; median follow-up 6Â·9 years [IQR 
5Â·9-8Â·0]) with all datapoints available for score generation. The MMAI algorithm 
(per SDâincrease) was strongly associated with PCSM (hazard ratio [HR] 1Â·40, 95% 
CI 1Â·30-1Â·51, p<0Â·0001). On ad-hoc inspection, the highest scoring quartile of 
patients in each disease and treatment allocation group (MMAIâQ4; vs the bottom 
three quartiles, Q1-3) had the highest PCSM risk in both patients with 
non-metastatic disease (HR 2Â·12, 1Â·61-2Â·81, p<0Â·0001) and those with metastatic 
disease (HR 1Â·62, 1Â·39-1Â·88, p<0Â·0001). MMAI quartile stratification split 
patients categorised by disease burden into groups with notably different risks 
of 5-year PCSM: patients with non-metastatic disease that were node-negative 
could be further stratified by MMAIâscore quartile Q1-3 (3%, 2-4) versus Q4 
(11%, 7-15), those with non-metastatic disease that were node-positive could be 
stratified by Q1-3 (11%, 8-14) versus Q4 (20%, 13-26), those with metastatic 
disease with low-volume could be stratified by Q1-3 (27%, 23-31) versus Q4 (43%, 
36-51), and those with metastatic disease with high-volume could be stratified 
by Q1-3 (48%, 44-52) versus Q4 (68%, 62-75).
INTERPRETATION: Diagnostic prostate biopsy samples contain prognostic 
information in patients with, or at high-risk of, radiologically overt 
metastatic prostate cancer. MMAI algorithm combined with disease burden improves 
prognostication of advanced prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Severe respiratory viral infections can lead to viral sepsis (VS), a 
life-threatening condition characterized by lung and extrapulmonary organ 
dysfunction. However, the pathology of VS is not clear. Specifically, it is 
unknown how the cytokine storm and direct virus infection contribute to the 
damage of extrapulmonary organs.
METHODS: In this study, we established survival and lethal mouse models of VS by 
intranasally administering different doses of PR8/H1N1 influenza virus in 
C57BL/6J male mice, as well as model of bacterial sepsis (BS) caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae as references. Viraemia and extrapulmonary 
dissemination and infection of the virus were examined. Single-cell sequencing 
of the lungs and livers was performed at different days post-infection (dpi) in 
three groups.
FINDINGS: While bacteria can spread and colonize extensively in extrapulmonary 
organs, causing multiple organ injuries, IAVs mainly replicate and cause damage 
in pulmonary cells. Live virus can be isolated in the blood and extrapulmonary 
organs. Disseminating via the bloodstream, IAVs transiently infect the liver and 
spleen, causing liver dysfunction and spleen atrophy, without affecting kidney 
function, despite systematically elevated cytokine levels. Compared to BS, a 
more significant decrease in the proportion of alveolar macrophages, epithelial 
cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in the lungs, as well as endothelial 
cells and Kupffer cells in the liver, was observed in VS. This was accompanied 
by a longer activated PANoptosis pathway and downregulated genes responsible for 
barrier function and antigen presentation in the epithelial and endothelial 
cells.
INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that H1N1 influenza virus disseminates 
through the bloodstream and infects extrapulmonary organs to varying extents, 
which may lead to differential cell death, organ dysfunction, and trigger VS.

Developing an efficient and safe therapy necessitates a mechanistic 
understanding of the complex underlying pathology and manipulation of the 
multiple pathways at the molecular and genetic level. Network-based simulation 
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a relatively well-understood cancer model, 
revealed the dynamics of simultaneously expressing pro-apoptotic BIM and 
silencing pro-survival MCL-1 in combination with the BCR-ABL-targeted tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Viral/nonviral chimeric nanoparticles (ChNPs) 
composed of a BIM-expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) core and a degradable 
polymeric shell that encapsulates MCL-1 siRNA (BIM/MCL-1 ChNPs) synergistically 
and selectively killed BCR-ABL+ CML cells in combination with dasatinib. In a 
mouse CML model, the BIM/MCL-1 ChNPs and dasatinib combination therapy 
suppressed proliferation of BCR-ABL+ hematopoietic cells and prevented leukemic 
infiltration of organs. The synergistic anti-leukemic effect was further 
pronounced in an acute phase model of the disease. This study investigated a 
strategy of developing a versatile and tunable multimodal therapy assisted by a 
computational toolset that analyzes the molecular foundation of a disease and 
predicts therapeutic response. The interdisciplinary approach developed and 
validated in this study can be used in discovering new therapies for cancer and 
other diseases.

Characterization of transcriptomic changes in the neurovascular unit of 
Alzheimiers transgenic mouse models using digital spatial profiling.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 40 million individuals globally and is 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) proteins, which aggregate 
and form plaques. BBB dysfunction drives AD cerebrovascular pathology and BBB 
integrity is maintained by neurovascular unit (NVU). Specifically, within the 
NVU, the cerebral endothelial cells maintain vascular homeostasis. In this 
study, we isolated endothelial-enriched regions of interest (ROIs) using the 
Nanostring GeoMx digital spatial profiler and employed a deconvolution model to 
evaluate transcriptomic changes. We observed dysregulation of cellular signaling 
potentially disrupting the APP+ BBB integrity. Analysis of ligand-receptor 
pairings that are the foundation of the NVU intercellular signaling indicated 
that the endothelial vasculature completes a feedback loop with the NVU to the 
regulating astroctyes. Further, we identified potentially antagonistic signaling 
roles for opioid receptor species that should be further investigated for 
potential therapeutic targets.

Background/Objectives: Surgical pathology of tubo-ovarian and peritoneal cancer 
carries a well-recognised diagnostic workload, partly due to the large amount of 
non-primary tumour-related tissue requiring assessment for the presence of 
metastatic disease. The lymph nodes and omentum are almost universally included 
in such resection cases and contribute considerably to this burden, principally 
due to volume rather than task complexity. To date, artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based studies have reported good success rates in identifying nodal spread 
in other malignancies, but the development of such time-saving assistive digital 
solutions has been neglected in ovarian cancer. This study aimed to detect the 
presence or absence of metastatic ovarian carcinoma in the lymph nodes and 
omentum. Methods: We used attention-based multiple-instance learning (ABMIL) 
with a vision-transformer foundation model to classify whole-slide images (WSIs) 
as either containing ovarian carcinoma metastases or not. Training and 
validation were conducted with a total of 855 WSIs of surgical resection 
specimens collected from 404 patients at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. 
Results: Ensembled classification from hold-out testing reached an AUROC of 
0.998 (0.985-1.0) and a balanced accuracy of 100% (100.0-100.0%) in the lymph 
node set, and an AUROC of 0.963 (0.911-0.999) and a balanced accuracy of 98.0% 
(94.8-100.0%) in the omentum set. Conclusions: This model shows great potential 
in the identification of ovarian carcinoma nodal and omental metastases, and 
could provide clinical utility through its ability to pre-screen WSIs prior to 
histopathologist review. In turn, this could offer significant time-saving 
benefits and streamline clinical diagnostic workflows, helping to address the 
chronic staffing shortages in histopathology.

Breast cancer remains a major global health concern where timely and accurate 
pathologic diagnosis is critical for effective management. The traditional 
reliance on expert interpretation of histopathology is increasingly challenged 
by rising workloads, inter-observer variability, and the complexity of current 
precision pathology. The advent of digital pathology through whole slide imaging 
(WSI) has enabled the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into breast 
pathology practice, offering promising solutions to these challenges. This 
review explores the major advancements of AI in breast pathology, including its 
applications in diagnosis and classification, histological grading, lymph node 
metastasis detection, and biomarker quantification (ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, and 
others). We also discuss AI's emerging roles in prognosis, treatment response, 
tumor microenvironment analysis, and the discovery of novel biomarkers. Despite 
the significant progress, barriers such as data quality, generalizability, model 
interpretability, regulatory challenges, and integration into clinical workflows 
remain. Future directions emphasize the development of foundation models, 
multimodal data integration, explainable AI, real-world clinical validation, and 
decentralized learning approaches. With careful navigation of these challenges 
and continued interdisciplinary collaboration, AI is poised to transform breast 
pathology and advance patient care.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative disorders 
(NDs) pose diagnostic challenges due to their diffuse and subtle pathological 
changes. Traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual histopathological 
slide inspection are labor-intensive and prone to variability, often missing 
subtle structural alterations. This study introduces an age-informed, 
attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) pipeline to predict AT8 
density, a key marker of p-tau aggregation in CTE. Using Luxol Fast Blue and 
Hematoxylin & Eosin (LH&E) stained images, our model identifies critical 
pathological regions and generates interpretable attention maps highlighting 
structural changes linked to tau pathology. Incorporating patient age enhances 
predictive accuracy and contextual understanding, addressing aging's confounding 
effects. We also develop quantitative evaluation procedures for foundation 
models (FMs), assessing attention map smoothness, faithfulness, and robustness 
to perturbations like stain variability and noise. These benchmarks facilitate 
informed FM selection and optimization for neuropathological tasks. By enabling 
scalable, automated whole-slide image (WSI) analysis, our approach advances 
digital neuropathology, supporting earlier and more precise ND diagnoses and 
uncovering subtle markers with potential applications in clinical imaging.

BACKGROUND: Imaging sensors (e.g., multispectral cameras) mounted on unmanned 
aerial systems (UAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for deriving insights about 
agricultural fields, from plant morphology phenotyping to plant disease 
monitoring. Advances in computer vision-based image analysis have enabled 
researchers to rapidly and accurately isolate crop spectra in UAS images. 
Specialty crops often employ unique production styles, such as trellising or 
inter-cropping. This presents a barrier to using existing image processing 
methodologies developed for broad-acre, row cropped systems (i.e. corn, wheat, 
soybean). Here, we present MAUI, a customizable image processing workflow built 
for specialty crops. Using a pathology research vineyard and hemp breeding trial 
as test cases, MAUI streamlines the generation of multispectral orthomosaic 
time-series, the segmentation of crops at the unit of research interest, and the 
extraction of crop spectra for downstream analysis.
RESULTS: We successfully used MAUI to collect and analyze UAS data at two field 
sites over two growing seasons. Of the five canopy segmentation methods we 
tested, a supervised deep convolutional neural network (DeepLabv3) and a vision 
foundation model (SAM) produced the most accurate crop masks for the vineyard 
and hemp images, with mean intersection over union (mIoU) values of 0.85 and 
0.95, respectively. Segmentation accuracy decreased when we applied each method 
to the other dataset, highlighting the importance of modular, flexible 
segmentation workflows for UAS imaging analysis in specialty crops.
CONCLUSION: We present a modular framework to efficiently extract spectral data 
for specialty crops from UAS imagery. We highlight two kinds of segmentation 
applied to trellised and row cropping systems to demonstrate the modularity and 
versatility of the proposed methodology. MAUI improved spectral discrimination 
between individual plants and treatment groups for hemp and grapevine, 
respectively. With the containerized deployment package and open-source 
codebase, MAUI can be widely adopted by specialty crop researchers to facilitate 
the integration of UAS imagery analysis into routine research.

To advance precision medicine in pathology, robust AI-driven foundation models 
are increasingly needed to uncover complex patterns in large-scale pathology 
datasets, enabling more accurate disease detection, classification, and 
prognostic insights. However, despite substantial progress in deep learning and 
computer vision, the comparative performance and generalizability of these 
pathology foundation models across diverse histopathological datasets and tasks 
remain largely unexamined. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive 
benchmarking of 31 AI foundation models for computational pathology, including 
general vision models (VM), general vision-language models (VLM), 
pathology-specific vision models (Path-VM), and pathology-specific 
vision-language models (Path-VLM), evaluated over 41 tasks sourced from TCGA, 
CPTAC, external benchmarking datasets, and out-of-domain datasets. Our study 
demonstrates that Virchow2, a pathology foundation model, delivered the highest 
performance across TCGA, CPTAC, and external tasks, highlighting its 
effectiveness in diverse histopathological evaluations. We also show that 
Path-VM outperformed both Path-VLM and VM, securing top rankings across tasks 
despite lacking a statistically significant edge over vision models. Our 
findings reveal that model size and data size did not consistently correlate 
with improved performance in pathology foundation models, challenging 
assumptions about scaling in histopathological applications. Lastly, our study 
demonstrates that a fusion model, integrating top-performing foundation models, 
achieved superior generalization across external tasks and diverse tissues in 
histopathological analysis. These findings emphasize the need for further 
research to understand the underlying factors influencing model performance and 
to develop strategies that enhance the generalizability and robustness of 
pathology-specific vision foundation models across different tissue types and 
datasets.

Diagnostic certainty is the cornerstone of modern medicine and critical for 
maximal treatment benefit. When evaluating biomarker expression by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), however, pathologists are hindered by complex 
scoring methodologies, unique positivity cut-offs and subjective staining 
interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially eliminate 
diagnostic uncertainty, especially when AI "trustworthiness" is proven by expert 
pathologists in the context of real-world clinical practice. Building on an IHC 
foundation model, we employed pathologists-in-the-loop finetuning to produce a 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) CPS AI Model. We devised a multi-head 
augmented reality microscope (ARM) system overlayed with the PD-L1 CPS AI Model 
to assess interobserver variability and gauge the pathologists' trust in AI 
model outputs. Using difficult to interpret regions on gastroesophageal 
biopsies, we show that AI-assistance improved case agreement between any 2 
pathologists by 14% (agreement on 77% vs 91%) and among 11 pathologists by 26% 
(agreement on 43% vs 69%). At a clinical cutoff of PD-L1 CPSââ¥â5, the number of 
cases diagnosed as positive by all 11 pathologists increased by 31%. Our 
findings underscore the benefits of fully engaging pathologists as active 
participants in the development and deployment of IHC AI models and frame the 
roadmap for trustworthy AI as a bridge to increased adoption in routine 
pathology practice.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution caused by ambient fine particulate matter (â¤ 2.5â¯Î¼m) 
adversely affects human health. Previous studies have shown that PM2.5 exposure 
increases the risk of lung diseases. However, the relationship between long-term 
PM2.5 exposure and new-onset lung diseases among middle-aged and older adults in 
China is still unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study through the China Health and 
Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and Science Data Bank (ScienceDB). The 
logistic regression model and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to explore 
the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and new-onset lung diseases. 
To further increase the robustness of the results, we performed sensitivity and 
subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 10,707 patients were included in this study. The 10,707 
patients were divided into two groups: without new-onset lung diseases 
(nâ¯=â¯9,019) and with new-onset lung diseases (nâ¯=â¯1,688). The results of 
multivariate analysis showed that per 1 ug/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 
concentration, the risk of new lung diseases increased by 0.3%. The results of 
the RCS showed that PM2.5 exposure increased the risk of new-onset lung diseases 
more significantly when the annual PM2.5 concentration was greater than 48.5 
ug/m3. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis also confirmed the reliability 
of the results.
CONCLUSION: PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of new-onset lung diseases among 
middle-aged and old adults in China, especially when the concentration of 
PM2.5â¯>â¯48.5 ug/m3. Our study established an empirical foundation for refining 
PM2.5 emission regulations, developing age-stratified screening protocols for 
incident pulmonary diseases, and advancing mechanistic investigations into 
PM2.5-induced lung pathology.

Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening vascular condition with limited 
pharmacological options, and shared risk factors with cardiac disease include 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, smoking, and dyslipidemia. This study 
investigated Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, in a 
BAPN/Ang-II-induced mouse model of AD, revealing significant therapeutic 
potential. Fer-1 significantly reduced AD incidence and mortality by preserving 
aortic wall integrity. RNA sequencing identified 922 differentially expressed 
genes, with 416 upregulated and 506 downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis 
revealed that Fer-1 modulates key regulators, such as MEF2C and KDM5A, impacting 
immune responses, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism. 
Additionally, Fer-1 alters miRNA expression, with the upregulation of miR-361-5p 
and downregulation of miR-3151-5p, targeting pathways involved in inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic stability. Functional 
pathway analysis highlighted the inhibition of actin cytoskeleton, ILK, and 
IL-17 signaling, essential for SMC differentiation and extracellular matrix 
remodeling. Gene interaction network analysis identified 21 central molecules, 
including CXCR3, ACACA, and BPGM, associated with lipid metabolism, 
inflammation, and vascular remodeling. This research elucidates the mechanism of 
ferroptosis in AD pathogenesis and establishes Fer-1 as a promising therapeutic 
intervention. AD and cardiac diseases share molecular mechanisms, risk factors, 
and pathological processes, positioning AD within the broader scope of 
cardiovascular pathology. By attenuating lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, 
and inflammation, Fer-1 may have cardioprotective effects beyond AD, providing a 
foundation for future translational research in cardiovascular medicine.

In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently developed, 
demonstrating enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. 
However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, 
particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition 
conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark 
four pathology-specific foundation models across 20 datasets and two scenarios - 
consistency assessment and flexibility assessment - addressing diverse 
adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment 
scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the 
parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for 
adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the 
same classification tasks. For slide-level survival prediction, the performance 
of foundation models depended on the choice of feature aggregation mechanisms 
and the characteristics of data. In the flexibility assessment scenario under 
data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed 
that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods 
that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide 
insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models 
in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of 
pathology image analysis. The code for this study is available at

Histopathology image analysis plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and 
treatment planning, relying heavily on accurate nuclei segmentation for 
extracting vital cellular information. In recent years, artificial intelligence 
(AI) and in particular deep learning models have been applied successfully in 
solving computational pathology image analysis tasks. The You Only Look Once 
(YOLO) object detection framework, which is based on a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) architecture has gained traction across various domains for its 
real-time processing capabilities. This systematic review aims to 
comprehensively explore and evaluate the advancements, challenges, and 
applications of YOLO-based methodologies in nuclei segmentation within the 
domain of histopathological images. The review encompasses a structured analysis 
of recent literature, focusing on the utilization of YOLO variants for nuclei 
segmentation. Key methodologies, training strategies, dataset specifics, and 
performance metrics are evaluated to elucidate the strengths and limitations of 
YOLO in this context. Additionally, the review highlights the unique 
characteristics of YOLO that enable efficient object detection and delineation 
of nuclei structures, offering a comparative analysis against traditional 
segmentation approaches. This systematic review underscores the promising 
outcomes achieved through YOLO-based architectures, emphasizing their potential 
for accurate and rapid nuclei segmentation. Furthermore, it identifies 
persistent challenges such as handling variances in nuclei appearances, 
optimizing model architectures for histopathological images, and improving 
generalization across diverse datasets. Insights derived from this review can 
provide a foundation for future research directions and enhancements in nuclei 
segmentation methodologies using YOLO within histopathology, fostering 
advancements in disease diagnosis and biomedical research.

The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in digital pathology is limited by 
technical inconsistencies in the production of whole slide images (WSIs). This 
causes degraded AI performance and poses a challenge for widespread clinical 
application, as fine-tuning algorithms for each site is impractical. Changes in 
the imaging workflow can also compromise diagnostic accuracy and patient safety. 
Physical color calibration of scanners, relying on a biomaterial-based calibrant 
slide and a spectrophotometric reference measurement, has been proposed for 
standardizing WSI appearance, but its impact on AI performance has not been 
investigated. We evaluated whether physical color calibration can enable robust 
AI performance. We trained fully supervised and foundation model-based AI 
systems for detecting and Gleason grading prostate cancer using WSIs of prostate 
biopsies from the STHLM3 clinical trial (nÂ = 3651) and evaluated their 
performance in 3 external cohorts (nÂ = 1161) with and without calibration. With 
physical color calibration, the fully supervised system's concordance with 
pathologists' grading (Cohen linearly weighted Îº) improved from 0.439 to 0.619 
in the Stavanger University Hospital cohort (nÂ = 860), from 0.354 to 0.738 in 
the Karolinska University Hospital cohort (nÂ = 229), and from 0.423 to 0.452 in 
the Aarhus University Hospital cohort (nÂ = 72). The foundation model's 
concordance improved as follows: from 0.739 to 0.760 (Karolinska), from 0.424 to 
0.459 (Aarhus), and from 0.547 to 0.670 (Stavanger). This study demonstrated 
that physical color calibration provides a potential solution to the variation 
introduced by different scanners, making AI-based cancer diagnostics more 
reliable and applicable in diverse clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: The Nottingham histologic grade is crucial for assessing severity 
and predicting prognosis in breast cancer, a prevalent cancer worldwide. 
Traditional grading systems rely on subjective expert judgment and require 
extensive pathological expertise, are time-consuming, and often lead to 
inter-observer variability.
METHODS: To address these limitations, we develop an AI-based model to predict 
Nottingham grade from whole-slide images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained 
breast cancer tissue using a pathology foundation model. From TCGA database, we 
trained and evaluated using 521Â H&E breast cancer slide images with available 
Nottingham scores through internal split validation, and further validated its 
clinical utility using an additional set of 597 cases without Nottingham scores. 
The model leveraged deep features extracted from a pathology foundation model 
(UNI) and incorporated 14 distinct multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms.
RESULTS: The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 0.731 and a 
multiclass average AUC of 0.835. The top 300 genes correlated with model 
predictions were significantly enriched in pathways related to cell division and 
chromosome segregation, supporting the model's biological relevance. The 
predicted grades demonstrated statistically significant association with 5-year 
overall survival (pâ<â0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our AI-based automated Nottingham grading system provides an 
efficient and reproducible tool for breast cancer assessment, offering potential 
for standardization of histologic grade in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the therapeutic effects of stellate ganglion block (SGB) on 
spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rats, and to explore its 
potential mechanisms in alleviating neuropathic pain, thereby providing a 
theoretical foundation for clinical treatment.
METHODS: A rat model of SCI was established, and animals were randomly assigned 
to one of three groups: the sham surgery group (Sham), the SCI group (SCI), or 
the SCI group treated with SGB (SCI + SGB). Motor function was assessed using 
the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, while thermal 
hyperalgesia was evaluated using hot plate test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) was utilized to measure the levels of inflammatory cytokines, 
including interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), 
within the spinal cord. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to observe 
spinal cord histopathology. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP 
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to detect apoptotic cells, and 
transmission electron microscopy was employed to visualize autophagosomes. 
Expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3-II/LC3-I and p62 was examined via 
Western blotting.
RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, rats in the SCI group displayed impaired 
hind limb motor function, decreased pain thresholds, elevated inflammatory 
cytokine levels, significant spinal cord pathology, increased apoptosis, altered 
expression of autophagy-related protein, and disrupted autophagic flux. In 
contrast, SGB treatment improved motor function, alleviated pain, reduced 
inflammatory cytokines levels, mitigated spinal cord injury and apoptosis, and 
enhanced autophagy with improved autophagic flux.
CONCLUSIONS: Stellate ganglion block alleviates neuropathic pain in SCI-induced 
rats by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, mitigating spinal cord 
apoptosis and injury, promoting autophagy, and restoring autophagic flux in the 
spinal cord.

BACKGROUND: The classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), 
also known as pituitary adenomas, has progressed significantly since 2004. The 
PitNET lineage now serves as the foundation of the classification. We 
investigated the prognostic value of clinicopathological markers in a cohort of 
patients diagnosed with acromegaly and prolactinomas who underwent 
transsphenoidal tumor resection.
METHODS: A total of 50 patients (45 patients with confirmed acromegaly and 5 
with prolactinomas) in evidence at 'C. I. Parhon National Institute of 
Endocrinology (Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Pathology Department, Bucharest, 
Romania), who underwent tumor resection between 2010 and 2023, was recruited, 
with a median follow-up time of 7.02 years (IQR: 3-10). Surgical samples were 
stained for anterior pituitary hormones, ki-67 labeling index, CAM 5.2 
expression, and the following transcription factors (TFs): steroidogenic factor 
(SF-1), T-box family member TBX19 (TPIT) and POU class 1 homeobox 1 (PIT-1). 
Additionally, somatostatin receptor 5 (SSTR 5) and 2 (SSTR 2) expression was 
evaluated in all patients.
RESULTS: Based on the 2022 WHO classification, the majority of cases were PIT-1 
lineage tumors (n=40, 72.7%), followed by TPIT-lineage (n=4, 7.3%), and SF-1 
lineage (n=3, 5.5%) and 14.5% (n=4) were classified as tumors with no distinct 
cell lineage (NDCL). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the 
postoperative GH value was independently associated with the outcome (HR 1.042, 
95% CI 1.004-1.081, p=0.030), as well as the postoperative PRL value (HR 1.95% 
CI 1,1.001, p=0.019), the ki-67 labelling index (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.109-5.330, 
p=0.026). Other factors associated as well with the success of the treatment 
were the postoperative tumor diameter (HR 1.038 95% CI 0.997-1.080, p=0.068) and 
the expression of SSTRs 2 and 5. Combining the four parameters, ki-67, SSTR 2, 
SSTR 5, GH, IGF-1 and the maximal tumor diameter (postoperative values), we 
established a prediction model with an AUC of 0.924 and relatively high 
sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: A clear classification system that can guide clinical and 
neurosurgical management of patients with GH- and PRL-secreting PitNETs is not 
currently available, but certain clinicopathological factors can be used to 
predict patient prognosis. In our study, somatostatin receptor expression, 
ki-67, and postoperative values of GH and IGF-1, as well as the maximal 
postoperative tumor diameter, were the strongest predictors of outcome.

Liquid biopsies are an emerging, noninvasive tool for cancer diagnostics, 
utilizing biological fluids for molecular profiling. Nevertheless, the current 
methods often lack the sensitivity and specificity necessary for early detection 
and real-time monitoring. This work explores an advanced approach to improving 
liquid biopsy techniques through machine learning analysis of the Raman spectra 
measured to classify distinct exosome solutions by their cancer origin. This was 
accomplished by conducting principal component analysis (PCA) of the Raman 
spectra of exosomes from three cancer cell lines (COLO205, A375, and LNCaP) to 
extract chemically significant features. This reduced set of features was then 
utilized to train a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to predict the 
source of the exosomes. Furthermore, we investigated differences in the lipid 
composition in these exosomes by their spectra. This spectral similarity 
analysis revealed differences in lipid profiles between the different cancer 
cell lines as well as identified the predominant lipids across all exosomes. Our 
PCA-LDA framework achieved 93.3% overall accuracy and F1 scores of 98.2%, 91.1%, 
and 91.0% for COLO205, A375, and LNCaP, respectively. Our results from spectral 
similarity analysis were also shown to support previous findings of lipid 
dynamics due to cancer pathology and pertaining to exosome function and 
structure. These findings underscore the benefits of enhancing Raman 
spectroscopy analysis with machine learning, laying the groundwork for the 
development of early noninvasive cancer diagnostics and personalized treatment 
strategies. This work potentially establishes the foundation for refining the 
classification model and optimizing exosome extraction and detection from 
clinical samples for clinical translation.

Pompe disease (PD) is a progressive myopathy caused by the aberrant accumulation 
of glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle resulting from the deficiency of the 
enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Administration of recombinant human GAA as 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) works well in alleviating the cardiac 
manifestations of PD but loses sustained benefit in ameliorating the skeletal 
muscle pathology. The limited efficacy of ERT in skeletal muscle is partially 
attributable to its inability to curb the accumulation of new glycogen produced 
by the muscle enzyme glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1). Substrate reduction therapies 
aimed at knocking down GYS1 expression represent a promising avenue to improve 
Pompe myopathy. However, finding specific inhibitors for GYS1 is challenging 
given the presence of the highly homologous GYS2 in the liver. Antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs) are chemically modified oligomers that hybridise to 
their complementary target RNA to induce their degradation with exquisite 
specificity. In the present study, we show that ASO-mediated Gys1 knockdown in 
the Gaa-/- mouse model of PD led to a robust reduction in glycogen accumulation 
in skeletal muscle. In addition, combining Gys1 ASO with ERT slightly further 
reduced glycogen content in muscle, eliminated autophagic buildup and lysosomal 
dysfunction, and improved motor function in Gaa-/- mice. Our results provide a 
strong foundation for validation of the use of Gys1 ASO, alone or in combination 
with ERT, as a therapy for PD. We propose that early administration of Gys1 ASO 
in combination with ERT may be the key to preventative treatment options in PD. 
KEY POINTS: Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment in a mouse model of Pompe 
disease achieves robust knockdown of glycogen synthase (GYS1). ASO treatment 
reduces glycogen content in skeletal muscle. Combination of ASO and enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) further improves motor performance compared to ASO 
alone in a mouse model of Pompe disease.

Ensuring trustworthiness is fundamental to the development of artificial 
intelligence (AI) that is considered societally responsible, particularly in 
cancer diagnostics, where a misdiagnosis can have dire consequences. Current 
digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness 
concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model 
deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed 
TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in 
non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 
1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope 
inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly 
ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal 
prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the 
framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both 
task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with 
TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of 
classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, 
while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM 
as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse 
architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in 
real-world settings.

OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
disease. Current understanding of the abnormal neural network in PD is limited, 
which may be one of the reasons for the lack of effective treatments. 
Tissue-clearing techniques allow visualization of neurons and gliocytes that 
form the structural basis of the abnormal neuronal network, thus enabling a 
deeper understanding of the pathological neuronal network in PD and contributing 
to the study of therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to create 
pathological maps of PD and perform 3D visualization of the neural network.
METHODS: We induced the PD model using 6-OHDA and a predesigned rotation test. 
We then performed tissue-clearing and 3D imaging of the whole-brain and brain 
slices of the mice using SHIELD and CUBIC.
RESULTS: The rotation test showed that the 6-OHDA group had a significant 
increase than the sham group. SHIELD results showed a significant reduction in 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signals in the substantia nigra (SN) + ventral 
tegmental area (VTA) and caudate putamen (CPu) regions in the 6-OHDA group 
compared to the sham group. Additionally, we performed 3D imaging and 
reconstruction of astrocytes, microglia, dopaminergic neurons, and blood vessels 
in the SN + VTA to visualize the neuronal network.
CONCLUSION: This study performed 3D imaging of the composition and spatial 
arrangement of neuronal vascular units at both macroscopic and microscopic 
levels, laying the foundation for the creation of a whole-brain pathological map 
of PD. It also provides a basis for exploring unknown neural circuits and 
visualizing them.

Limosilactobacillus reuteri is an immunomodulatory bacterium enriched in 
non-industrialized microbiomes, making it a therapeutic candidate for chronic 
diseases. However, effects of L. reuteri strains in mouse models of multiple 
sclerosis have been contradictory. Here, we show that treatment of spontaneous 
relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice with L. 
reuteri R2lc, a strain that activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
through the pks gene cluster, resulted in severe pathology. In contrast, a pks 
mutant and a pks-negative strain (PB-W1) failed to exacerbate EAE and exhibited 
reduced pathology compared to R2lc despite earlier disease onset in PB-W1 mice. 
Differences in pathology occurred in parallel with a pks-dependent 
downregulation of AhR-related genes, reduced occludin expression in the 
forebrain, and altered concentrations of immune cells. This work establishes a 
molecular foundation for strain-specific effects on autoimmunity, which has 
implications for our understanding of how microbes contribute to chronic 
conditions and the selection of microbial therapeutics.

The adoption of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation has made 
integrating health data critical for both primary and secondary applications. 
Primary use cases include patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, while 
secondary applications support research, innovation, and regulatory 
decision-making. Additionally, leveraging large datasets improves training 
quality for artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in cancer 
prevention, prediction, and treatment personalization. The European Union (EU) 
has recently funded multiple projects under Europe's Beating Cancer Plan. 
However, these projects face challenges related to fragmentation and the lack of 
standardization in metadata, data storage, access, and processing. This paper 
examines interoperability standards used in six EU-funded cancer-related 
projects: IDERHA (Integration of Heterogeneous Data and Evidence Towards 
Regulatory and Health Technology Assessments Acceptance), EUCAIM (European 
Cancer Imaging Initiative), ASCAPE (Artificial Intelligence Supporting Cancer 
Patients Across Europe), iHelp, BigPicture, and the HealthData@EU pilot. These 
initiatives aim to enhance the analysis of heterogeneous health data while 
aligning with EHDS implementation, specifically for the EHDS for the secondary 
use of data (EHDS2). Between October 2023 and July 2024, we organized meetings 
and workshops among these projects to assess how they adopt health standards and 
apply Internet of Things (IoT) semantic interoperability. The discussions 
focused on interoperability standards for health data, knowledge graphs, the 
data quality framework, patient-generated health data, AI reasoning, federated 
approaches, security, and privacy. Based on our findings, we developed a 
template for designing the EHDS2 interoperability framework in alignment with 
the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and EHDS governance standards. 
This template maps EHDS2-recommended standards to the EIF model and principles, 
linking the proposed EHDS2 data quality framework to relevant International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. Using this template, we 
analyzed and compared how the recommended EHDS2 standards were implemented 
across the studied projects. During workshops, project teams shared insights on 
overcoming interoperability challenges and their innovative approaches to 
bridging gaps in standardization. With support from HSbooster.eu, we facilitated 
collaboration among these projects to exchange knowledge on standards, legal 
implementation, project sustainability, and harmonization with EHDS2. The 
findings from this work, including the created template and lessons learned, 
will be compiled into an interactive toolkit for the EHDS2 interoperability 
framework. This toolkit will help existing and future projects align with EHDS2 
technical and legal requirements, serving as a foundation for a common EHDS2 
interoperability framework. Additionally, standardization efforts include 
participation in the development of ISO/IEC 21823-3:2021-Semantic 
Interoperability for IoT Systems. Since no ISO standard currently exists for 
digital pathology and AI-based image analysis for medical diagnostics, the 
BigPicture project is contributing to ISO/PWI 24051-2, which focuses on digital 
pathology and AI-based, whole-slide image analysis. Integrating these efforts 
with ongoing ISO initiatives can enhance global standardization and facilitate 
widespread adoption across health care systems.

extremely successful. While many successful models have been built using 
general-purpose models trained largely on everyday objects, there is a recent 
trend toward pathology-specific foundation models, trained using histopathology 
images. Pathology foundation models show strong performance on cancer detection 
and subtyping, grading, and predicting molecular diagnoses. However, we have 
noticed lacunae in the testing of foundation models. Nearly all the benchmarks 
used to test them are focused on cancer. Neoplasia is an important pathologic 
mechanism and key concern in much of clinical pathology, but it represents one 
of many pathologic bases of disease. Non-neoplastic pathology dominates findings 
in the placenta, a critical organ in human development, as well as a specimen 
commonly encountered in clinical practice. Very little to none of the data used 
in training pathology foundation models is placenta. Thus, placental pathology 
is doubly out of distribution, representing a useful challenge for foundation 
models. We developed benchmarks for estimation of gestational age, classifying 
normal tissue, identifying inflammation in the umbilical cord and membranes, and 
in classification of macroscopic lesions including villous infarction, 
intervillous thrombus, and perivillous fibrin deposition. We tested 5 pathology 
foundation models and 4 non-pathology models for each benchmark in tasks 
including zero-shot K-nearest neighbor classification and regression, 
content-based image retrieval, supervised regression, and whole-slide 
attention-based multiple instance learning. In each task, the best performing 
model was a pathology foundation model. However, the gap between pathology and 
non-pathology models was diminished in tasks related to inflammation or those in 
which a supervised task was performed using model embeddings. Performance was 
comparable among pathology foundation models. Among non-pathology models, ResNet 
consistently performed worse, while models from the present decade showed better 
performance. Future work could examine the impact of incorporating placental 
data into foundation model training.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying deep learning combined 
with a super-resolution scanner for the digital scanning and diagnosis of oral 
epithelial dysplasia (OED) slides. A model of a super-resolution digital slide 
scanning system based on deep learning was built and trained using 40 
pathological slides of oral epithelial tissue. Two hundred slides with definite 
OED diagnoses were scanned into digital slides by the DS30R and Nikon scanners, 
and the scanner parameters were obtained for comparison. Considering that 
diagnosis under a microscope is the gold standard, the sensitivity and 
specificity of OED pathological feature recognition by the same pathologist when 
reading different scanner images were evaluated. Furthermore, the consistency of 
whole-slide diagnosis results obtained by pathologists using various digital 
scanning imaging systems was assessed. This was done to evaluate the feasibility 
of the super-resolution digital slide-scanning system, which is based on deep 
learning, for the pathological diagnosis of OED. The DS30R scanner processes an 
entire slide in a single layer within 0.25â¯min, occupying 0.35GB of storage. In 
contrast, the Nikon scanner requires 15â¯min for scanning, utilizing 0.5GB of 
storage. Following model training, the system enhanced the clarity of imaging 
pathological sections of oral epithelial tissue. Both the DS30R and Nikon 
scanners demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for detecting structural 
features in OED pathological images; however, DS30R excels at identifying 
certain cellular features. The agreement in full-section diagnostic conclusions 
by the same pathologist using different imaging systems was exceptionally high, 
with kappa values of 0.969 for DS30R-optical microscope and 0.979 for 
DS30R-Nikon-optical microscope. The performance of the super-resolution 
microscopic imaging system based on deep learning has improved. It preserves the 
diagnostic information of the OED and addresses the shortcomings of existing 
digital scanners, such as slow imaging speed, large data volumes, and challenges 
in rapid transmission and sharing. This high-quality super-resolution image lays 
a solid foundation for the future popularization of artificial intelligence (AI) 
technology and will aid AI in the accurate diagnosis of oral potential malignant 
diseases.

Computational pathology, utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) for pathological 
diagnosis, has advanced the development of intelligent healthcare. However, the 
scarcity of annotated data and histological differences hinder the general 
application of existing methods. Extensive histopathological data and the 
robustness of self-supervised models in small-scale data demonstrate promising 
prospects for developing foundation pathology models. Here we show BEPH 
(BEiT-based model Pre-training on Histopathological image), a foundation model 
that leverages self-supervised learning to learn meaningful representations from 
11 million unlabeled histopathological images. These representations are then 
efficiently adapted to various tasks, including patch-level cancer diagnosis, 
WSI-level cancer classification, and survival prediction for multiple cancer 
subtypes. By leveraging the masked image modeling (MIM) pre-training approach, 
BEPH offers an efficient solution to enhance model performance, reduce the 
reliance on expert annotations, and facilitate the broader application of 
artificial intelligence in clinical settings. The pre-trained model is available 
at https://github.com/Zhcyoung/BEPH .

PURPOSE: This study explores the application of machine learning to 
high-dimensional proteomics datasets for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers. AD, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, 
necessitates early and accurate diagnosis for effective management.
METHODS: We leverage Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics data from the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the frontal cortex of patients with 
idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a condition often comorbid with 
AD, with rare access to both lumbar and ventricular samples. Our methodology 
includes extensive data preprocessing to address batch effects and missing 
values, followed by the use of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 
(SMOTE) for data augmentation to overcome the small sample size. We apply 
linear, and non-linear machine learning models, and ensemble methods, to compare 
iNPH patients with and without biomarker evidence of AD pathology ( AÎ²-T- or 
AÎ²+T+ ) in a classification task.
RESULTS: We present a machine learning workflow for working with 
high-dimensional TMT proteomics data that addresses their inherent data 
characteristics. Our results demonstrate that batch effect correction has no or 
minor impact on the models' performance and robust feature selection is critical 
for model stability and performance, especially in the high-dimensional 
proteomics data setting for AD diagnostics. The results further indicated that 
removing features with missing values produced stronger models than imputing 
them, and the batch effect had minimal impact on the models Our best-performing 
disease-progression detection model, a random forest, achieves an AUC of 0.84 (Â± 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: We identify several novel protein biomarkers candidates, such as 
FABP3 and GOT1, with potential diagnostic value for AD pathology detection, 
suggesting the necessity of different biomarkers for AD diagnoses for patients 
with iNPH, and considering different biomarkers for ventricular and lumbar CSF 
samples. This work underscores the importance of a meticulous machine learning 
process in enhancing biomarker discovery. Our study also provides insights in 
translating biomarkers from other central nervous system diseases like iNPH, and 
both ventricular and lumbar CSF samples for biomarker discovery, providing a 
foundation for future research and clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of early recurrence is essential for disease 
management of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We aimed 
to develop and validate a deep learning-based early recurrence predictive model 
(ERPM) and a treatment response predictive model (TRPM) on whole slide images to 
assist clinical decision making.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we included consecutive 
patients with pathology-confirmed NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection of 
bladder tumour from five centres. Patients from one hospital (Sun Yat-sen 
Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China) were assigned to 
training and internal validation cohorts, and patients from four other hospitals 
(the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and Zhujiang Hospital 
of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; the Fifth Affiliated Hospital 
of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China; Shenshan Medical Centre, Shanwei, 
China) were assigned to four independent external validation cohorts. Based on 
multi-instance and ensemble learning, the ERPM was developed to make predictions 
on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry staining 
slides. Sharing the same architecture of the ERPM, the TRPM was trained and 
evaluated by cross validation on patients who received Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin 
(BCG). The performance of the ERPM was mainly evaluated and compared with the 
clinical model, H&E-based model, and integrated model through the area under the 
curve. Survival analysis was performed to assess the prognostic capability of 
the ERPM.
FINDINGS: Between January 1, 2017, and September 30, 2023, 4395 whole slide 
images of 1275 patients were included to train and validate the models. The ERPM 
was superior to the clinical and H&E-based model in predicting early recurrence 
in both internal validation cohort (area under the curve: 0.837 vs 0.645 vs 
0.737) and external validation cohorts (area under the curve: 0.761-0.802 vs 
0.626-0.682 vs 0.694-0.723) and was on par with the integrated model. It also 
stratified recurrence-free survival significantly (pÂ <Â 0.0001) with a hazard 
ratio of 4.50 (95% CI 3.10-6.53). The TRPM performed well in predicting 
BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (accuracy 84.1%).
INTERPRETATION: The ERPM showed promising performance in predicting early 
recurrence and recurrence-free survival of patients with NMIBC after surgery and 
with further validation and in combination with TRPM could be used to guide the 
management of NMIBC.

INTRODUCTION: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are relatively common cerebrovascular 
anomalies. Melatonin could modulate inflammatory and offers neuroprotective 
effects, and its role in IA has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: An elastase-induced IA mouse model was constructed and melatonin 
(150Â mg/kg) was administered to investigate its therapeutic effects on IA. 
Aneurysm formation was observed by bromophenol blue gelatin perfusion, and the 
pathology changes in IA mice were examined using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) 
staining. The potential mechanisms of melatonin treatment of IA were explored 
using western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, real-time qPCR, 
immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. An H2O2-reduced human brain vascular 
smooth muscle cells (HBVSMC) injury model was also constructed.
RESULTS: The formation of aneurysms was observed in the circle of Willis in the 
IA mice. Melatonin treatment alleviated the thinning of blood vessel walls and 
disruption of the internal elastic lamina in IA mice. The levels of Bcl-2 were 
significantly increased and Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were decreased in IA mice 
with melatonin treatment, suggesting reduced apoptosis. Furthermore, melatonin 
reduced levels of interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-Î±) in IA mice. The H2O2-reduced HBVSMCs model showed consistent results. 
Melatonin reduced levels of krÃ¼ppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) in IA mice. 
Importantly, melatonin significantly reduced levels of regulatory T cells 
(Treg), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î±, nuclear factor interleukin 
3-regulated (NFIL3), TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP), and 
increased levels of monocytes in IA mice.
CONCLUSION: Melatonin mitigates IA injury by modulating immune cells and 
hypoxia-related factors. These findings provide an exploratory foundation for 
therapeutic strategies in IA.

Innate immune activation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, 
involving cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), has 
emerged as a key mediator of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise 
mechanisms through which cGAS activation influences AD progression remain poorly 
understood. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of cGAS-STING 
signaling pathway in AD. Notably, this increase is primarily attributed to 
microglia, rather than non-microglial cell types. Using an inducible, 
microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in the 5xFAD background, we 
demonstrated that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) 
pathology profoundly restricts plaque accumulation and protects mice from 
AÎ²-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, our study revealed cGAS 
promotes plaque-associated microglia accumulation and is essential for 
inflammasome activation. Moreover, we showed that restricting cGAS-mediated 
innate immunity is crucial for preserving inter-cellular communication in the 
brain and induces pleiotrophin, a neuroprotective factor. These findings offer 
novel insights into the specific roles of the innate immune system in AD 
employing a cell-type-specific approach. TheÂ conclusions provide a foundation 
for targeted interventions to modulate the microglial cGAS-STING signaling 
pathway, offering promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.

Due to the increasing workload of pathologists, the need for automation to 
support diagnostic tasks and quantitative biomarker evaluation is becoming more 
and more apparent. Foundation models have the potential to improve 
generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data 
efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training 
of foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, 
computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that 
drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task 
learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, 
segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the 
encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the 
Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the 
Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images 
from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and 
prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve 
comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring 
only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts 
encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and 
out-of-domain data. The pre-trained models and will be made available under 
https://github.com/FraunhoferMEVIS/MedicalMultitaskModeling.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) within pathology and health care has 
advanced extensively. We have accordingly witnessed an increased adoption of 
various AI tools that are transforming our approach to clinical decision 
support, personalized medicine, predictive analytics, automation, and discovery. 
The familiar and more reliable AI tools that have been incorporated within 
health care thus far fall mostly under the nongenerative AI domain, which 
includes supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. This 
review article explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional 
rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency 
within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models 
(ie, classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector 
machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural 
networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based 
nongenerative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including 
clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed 
for their roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. 
Technical details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for 
analyzing whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, 
explainability, and reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for 
clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data 
quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of 
which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is 
imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these 
traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.

Whole slide images (WSIs) play a vital role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. 
However, their gigapixel resolution, lack of pixel-level annotations, and 
reliance on unimodal visual data present challenges for accurate and efficient 
computational analysis. Existing methods typically divide WSIs into thousands of 
patches, which increases computational demands and makes it challenging to 
effectively focus on diagnostically relevant regions. Furthermore, these methods 
frequently rely on feature extractors pretrained on natural images, which are 
not optimized for pathology tasks, and overlook multimodal data sources such as 
cellular and textual information that can provide critical insights. To address 
these limitations, we propose the Abnormality-Aware MultiModal (AAMM) learning 
framework, which integrates abnormality detection and multimodal feature 
learning for WSI classification. AAMM incorporates a Gaussian Mixture 
Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to identify and select the most informative 
patches, reducing computational complexity while retaining critical diagnostic 
information. It further integrates multimodal features from pathology-specific 
foundation models, combining patch-level, cell-level, and text-level 
representations through cross-attention mechanisms. This approach enhances the 
ability to comprehensively analyze WSIs for cancer diagnosis and subtyping. 
Extensive experiments on normal-tumor classification and cancer subtyping 
demonstrate that AAMM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 
methods. By combining abnormal detection with multimodal feature integration, 
our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for advancing 
computational pathology.

APP knock-in (KI) mice serve as an exciting new model system to understand 
amyloid beta (AÎ²) pathology, overcoming many of the limitations of previous 
overexpression-based model systems. The APPSAA mouse model (containing the 
humanized APP with three familial Alzheimer's disease mutations) and the APPWT 
control (containing wildtype humanized APP) are the first commercially available 
APP KI mice within the United States. While APPSAA mice have been shown to 
develop progressive AÎ² pathology and neuroinflammation, the age at which 
behavioral and cognitive impairments begin to develop has yet to be described. 
Therefore, we performed an in-depth longitudinal study over 16 months, assessing 
cognition in these two strains, as well as assessments of motor function. While 
no cognitive deficits are observed in either genotype throughout the first year 
of life, 16-month-old APPSAA, but not APPWT mice show initial signs of spatial 
memory decline. In addition, both genotypes display impaired motor function at 
the same age. Together, this data identifies a timeframe where behavioral 
deficits appear, providing an essential foundation for future studies using 
these model systems.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that can cause lethal disease in 
immunocompromised patients. Immunocompetent host immune responses, such as 
formation of pulmonary granulomas, control the infection and prevent 
disseminated disease. Little is known about the immunological conditions 
establishing the latent infection granuloma in the lungs. To investigate this, 
we performed an analysis of pulmonary immune cell populations, cytokine changes, 
and granuloma formation during infection with a latent disease-causing clinical 
isolate in C3HeB/FeJ mice over 360 days. We found that latently infected mice 
progress through three phases of granuloma formation where different immune 
profiles dominate: an early phase characterized by eosinophilia, high 
IL-4/IL-13, and C. neoformans proliferation in the lungs; an intermediate phase 
characterized by multinucleated giant cell formation, high IL-1Î±/IFNÎ³, granuloma 
expansion, and increased blood antigen levels; and a late phase characterized by 
a significant expansion of T cells, granuloma condensation, and decreases in 
lung fungal burden and blood antigen levels. These findings highlight a complex 
series of immune changes that occur during the establishment of granulomas that 
control C. neoformans in the lungs and lay the foundation for studies to 
identify critical beneficial immune responses to Cryptococcus 
infections.IMPORTANCECryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that 
disseminates from the lungs to the brain to cause fatal disease. Latent C. 
neoformans infection in the lungs is controlled by organized collections of 
immune cells called granulomas. The formation and structure of Cryptococcus 
granulomas are poorly understood due to inconsistent human pathology results and 
disagreement between necrotic granuloma-forming rat models and non-necrotic 
granuloma-forming mouse models. To overcome this, we investigated granuloma 
formation during latent C. neoformans infection in the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain 
which forms necrotic lung granulomas in response to other pathogens. We found 
that latent C. neoformans granuloma formation progresses through phases that we 
described as early, intermediate, and late with different immune response 
profiles and granulomatous characteristics. Ultimately, we show that C3HeB/FeJ 
mice latently infected with C. neoformans form non-necrotic granulomas and could 
provide a novel mouse model to investigate host immune response profiles.

MOTIVATION: Endometrial cancer is a prevalent gynecological malignancy that 
requires accurate identification of its molecular subtypes for effective 
diagnosis and treatment. Four molecular subtypes with different clinical 
outcomes have been identified: POLE mutation, mismatch repair deficient, p53 
abnormal, and no specific molecular profile. However, determining these subtypes 
typically relies on expensive gene sequencing. To overcome this limitation, we 
propose a novel method that utilizes hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide 
images to predict endometrial cancer molecular subtypes.
RESULTS: Our approach leverages a hierarchical foundation model as a backbone, 
fine-tuned from the UNI computational pathology foundation model, to extract 
tissue embedding from different scales. We have achieved promising results 
through extensive experimentation on the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center 
cohort (Nâ=â364). Our model demonstrates a macro-average AUROC of 0.879 (95% CI, 
0.853-0.904) in a five-fold cross-validation. Compared to the current 
state-of-the-art molecular subtypes prediction for endometrial cancer, our 
method outperforms in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. 
Moreover, our method is highly reproducible, allowing for ease of implementation 
and widespread adoption. This study aims to address the cost and time 
constraints associated with traditional gene sequencing techniques. By providing 
a reliable and accessible alternative to gene sequencing, our method has the 
potential to revolutionize the field of endometrial cancer diagnosis and improve 
patient outcomes.

Growing evidence indicates that persons with Parkinson disease (PD), have a 
unique composition of indigenous gut microbes. Given the long prodromal or 
pre-diagnosed period, longitudinal studies of the human and rodent gut 
microbiome before symptomatic onset and for the duration of the disease are 
currently lacking. PD is partially characterized by the accumulation of the 
protein Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) into insoluble aggregates, in both the central and 
enteric nervous systems. As such, several experimental rodent and non-human 
primate models of Î±-syn overexpression recapitulate some of the hallmark 
pathophysiologies of PD. These animal models provide an opportunity to assess 
how the gut microbiome changes with age under disease-relevant conditions. Here, 
we used a transgenic mouse strain, which overexpress wild-type human Î±-syn to 
test how the gut microbiome composition responds in this model of PD pathology 
during aging. Using shotgun metagenomics, we find significant, age and 
genotype-dependent bacterial taxa whose abundance becomes altered with age. We 
reveal that Î±-syn overexpression can drive alterations to the gut microbiome 
composition and suggest that it limits diversity through age. Taxa that were 
most affected by genotype-age interaction were Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. 
In a mouse model, we showed direct link between alpha synuclein geneotype 
(hallmark of PD), a dysbiotic and low-diversity gut microbiome, and dysbiotic 
levels of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus (most robust features of PD 
microbiome). Given emerging data on the potential contributions of the gut 
microbiome to PD pathologies, our data provide an experimental foundation to 
understand how the PD-associated microbiome may arise as a trigger or 
co-pathology to disease.

A state-of-the-art scaffold capable of efficiently reconstructing the 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc after discectomy remains elusive. The major 
challenge has been to identify a degradable scaffold that remodels into TMJ 
disc-like tissue, and prevents increased joint pathology, among other 
significant complications. Tissue engineering research provides a foundation for 
promising approaches towards the creation of successful implants/scaffolds that 
aim to restore the disc. In light of improving the quality of life of patients 
who undergo TMJ disc removal, it is critical to establish a preclinical animal 
model to evaluate the properties of promising scaffolds implanted 
post-discectomy and to determine the most efficient implantation procedures to 
ensure a more reliable in-depth evaluation of the biomaterial replacing the 
articular disc. The present study evaluated the outcomes of two protocols for 
implantation of an acellular scaffold composed of an extracellular matrix (ECM) 
derived from the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) of the pig, as a regenerative 
template for the TMJ disc in a goat model. The outcomes suggest that leaving 
one-half of the disc medially will allow anchoring of the device to the medial 
aspect of the joint while avoiding lateral displacement of the ECM scaffold. The 
goat model is ideal to assess the longevity of tissue-engineered solutions for 
the TMJ disc, considering that goats chew for 12-16 hours a day. This study 
provides an important reference for the selection of a suitable scaffold 
implantation procedure and the goat model for the development of new strategies 
to assess TMJ disc regeneration.

Accurate image classification and retrieval are of importance for clinical 
diagnosis and treatment decision-making. The recent contrastive language-image 
pre-training (CLIP) model has shown remarkable proficiency in understanding 
natural images. Drawing inspiration from CLIP, pathology-dedicated CLIP 
(PathCLIP) has been developed, utilizing over 200,000 image and text pairs in 
training. While the performance the PathCLIP is impressive, its robustness under 
a wide range of image corruptions remains unknown. Therefore, we conduct an 
extensive evaluation to analyze the performance of PathCLIP on various corrupted 
images from the datasets of osteosarcoma and WSSS4LUAD. In our experiments, we 
introduce eleven corruption types including brightness, contrast, defocus, 
resolution, saturation, hue, markup, deformation, incompleteness, rotation, and 
flipping at various settings. Through experiments, we find that PathCLIP 
surpasses OpenAI-CLIP and the pathology language-image pre-training (PLIP) model 
in zero-shot classification. It is relatively robust to image corruptions 
including contrast, saturation, incompleteness, and orientation factors. Among 
the eleven corruptions, hue, markup, deformation, defocus, and resolution can 
cause relatively severe performance fluctuation of the PathCLIP. This indicates 
that ensuring the quality of images is crucial before conducting a clinical 
test. Additionally, we assess the robustness of PathCLIP in the task of 
image-to-image retrieval, revealing that PathCLIP performs less effectively than 
PLIP on osteosarcoma but performs better on WSSS4LUAD under diverse corruptions. 
Overall, PathCLIP presents impressive zero-shot classification and retrieval 
performance for pathology images, but appropriate care needs to be taken when 
using it.

Pathology plays a crucial role in diagnosing and evaluating patient tissue 
samples obtained via surgeries and biopsies. The advent of whole slide scanners 
and the development of deep learning technologies have considerably advanced 
this field, promoting extensive research and development in pathology artificial 
intelligence (AI). These advancements have contributed to reduced workload of 
pathologists and supported decision-making in treatment plans. Large-scale AI 
models, known as foundation models (FMs), are more accurate and applicable to 
various tasks than traditional AI. Such models have recently emerged and 
expanded their application scope in healthcare. Numerous FMs have been developed 
in pathology, with reported applications in various tasks, such as disease and 
rare cancer diagnoses, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker 
expression prediction, and scoring of the immunohistochemical expression 
intensity. However, several challenges persist in the clinical application of 
FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research to 
address these challenges is ongoing. In the future, the development of 
generalist medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other 
medical domains, is expected to progress, effectively utilizing AI in real 
clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal polyps are commonly observed in patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD) and pose a significant clinical concern because of their 
potential for malignancy.
AIM: To explore the clinical characteristics of colorectal polyps in patients 
with CLD, a nomogram was established to predict the presence of adenomatous 
polyps (AP).
METHODS: Patients with CLD who underwent colonoscopy at Tianjin Second People's 
Hospital from January 2020 to May 2023 were evaluated. Clinical data including 
laboratory results, colonoscopy findings, and pathology reports were collected. 
Key variables for the nomogram were identified through least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator regression, followed by multivariate logistic regression. 
The performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver 
area under curve, as well as calibration curves and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 870 participants who underwent colonoscopy, and the 
detection rate of AP in patients with CLD was 28.6%. Compared to individuals 
without polyps, six risk factors were identified as predictors for AP 
occurrence: Age, male sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, overlapping 
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and serum ferritin 
levels. The novel nomogram (AP model) demonstrated an area under curve of 0.801 
(95% confidence interval: 0.756-0.845) and 0.785 (95% confidence interval: 
0.712-0.858) in the training and validation groups. Calibration curves indicated 
good agreement among predicted and actual probabilities (training: Ï 2 = 11.860, 
P = 0.157; validation: Ï 2 = 7.055, P = 0.530). The decision curve analysis 
underscored the clinical utility of the nomogram for predicting the risk of AP.
CONCLUSION: The AP model showed reasonable accuracy and provided a clinical 
foundation for predicting the occurrence of AP in patients with CLD, which has a 
certain predictive value.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dihydroartemisinin (DHA) attenuates 
ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice by 
inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation and to explore its potential 
molecular mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology analysis was used to screen relevant 
targets, and molecular docking of DHA with core targets was performed. Molecular 
dynamics simulation of the target with the lowest binding free energy, 
NQO1-DHA.The renal protective effect of DHA on the IRI-induced AKI mouse model 
was evaluated. The expression levels of NQO1, Nrf2 and other proteins were 
detected by Western blotting. The expression levels of Nrf2 and others were 
detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF).
RESULTS: Through network pharmacological analysis, we obtained that PI3K/AKT and 
MAPK signaling pathway may be related to DHA in the treatment of AKI.Molecular 
dynamics simulation indicated that NQO1 is an important target protein for DHA 
to exert nephroprotective effects.Moreover, the potential molecular mechanisms 
were verified by experiments.DHA reduced the serum creatinine (Scr) and urea 
nitrogen (BUN) levels in AKI mice, significantly improved AKI pathology, 
alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory injury, which may be related to its 
activation of the Nrf2 pathway and regulation of macrophage polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: Through network pharmacology, molecular dynamics simulation and 
experimental validation, we initially investigated that DHA alleviate AKI by 
ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammatory damage, which may be related to 
its activation of the Nrf2 pathway and the regulation of macrophage 
polarisation, which lays the foundation for subsequent in-depth study of the 
specific mechanism of action.

The segment anything model (SAM) was released as a foundation model for image 
segmentation. The promptable segmentation model was trained by over 1 billion 
masks on 11M licensed and privacy-respecting images. The model supports 
zero-shot image segmentation with various segmentation prompts (e.g., points, 
boxes, masks). It makes the SAM attractive for medical image analysis, 
especially for digital pathology where the training data are rare. In this 
study, we evaluate the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM model on 
representative segmentation tasks on whole slide imaging (WSI), including (1) 
tumor segmentation, (2) non-tumor tissue segmentation, (3) cell nuclei 
segmentation.
CORE RESULTS: The results suggest that the zero-shot SAM model achieves 
remarkable segmentation performance for large connected objects. However, it 
does not consistently achieve satisfying performance for dense instance object 
segmentation, even with 20 prompts (clicks/boxes) on each image. We also 
summarized the identified limitations for digital pathology: (1) image 
resolution, (2) multiple scales, (3) prompt selection, and (4) model 
fine-tuning. In the future, the few-shot fine-tuning with images from downstream 
pathological segmentation tasks might help the model to achieve better 
performance in dense object segmentation.

The combination of artificial intelligence and digital pathology has emerged as 
a transformative force in healthcare and biomedical research. As an update to 
our 2018 review, this review presents comprehensive analysis of machine learning 
applications in histopathological image analysis, with focus on the developments 
since 2018. We highlight significant advances that have expanded the technical 
capabilities and practical applications of computational pathology. The review 
examines progress in addressing key challenges in the field as follows: 
processing of gigapixel whole slide images, insufficient labeled data, 
multidimensional analysis, domain shifts across institutions, and 
interpretability of machine learning models. We evaluate emerging trends, such 
as foundation models and multimodal integration, that are reshaping the field. 
Overall, our review highlights the potential of machine learning in enhancing 
both routine pathological analysis and scientific discovery in pathology. By 
providing this comprehensive overview, this review aims to guide researchers and 
clinicians in understanding the current state of the pathology image analysis 
field and its future trajectory.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results for computational 
pathology tasks. However, one of the limitations in clinical practice is that 
these algorithms are optimised for the distribution represented by the training 
data. For out-of-distribution (OOD) data, they often deliver predictions with 
equal confidence, even though these often are incorrect. In the pursuit of OOD 
detection in digital pathology, this study evaluates the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
in computational pathology OOD detection, based on diffusion probabilistic 
models, specifically by adapting the latent diffusion model (LDM) for this 
purpose (AnoLDM). We compare this against post-hoc methods based on the latent 
space of foundation models, which are SOTA in general computer vision research. 
The approaches are not only evaluated on data from the same medical centres as 
the training set, but also on several datasets with data distribution shifts. 
The results show that AnoLDM performs similarly well or better than diffusion 
model based approaches published in previous studies in computational pathology 
but with reduced computational costs. However, our optimal configuration of an 
approach based on foundation models (kang_residual) outperforms AnoLDM on OOD 
detection on data not experiencing any covariate shifts, with an AUROC of 96.17 
versus 91.86. Interestingly, AnoLDM is more successful at handling the data 
distribution shifts investigated in this study. However, both AnoLDM and 
kang_residual suffer substantial loss in the performance under the data 
distribution shifts, hence future work should focus on improving the 
generalisation of OOD detection for computational pathology applications.

BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer that varies in 
clinical behavior. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common RCC subtype, with 
both aggressive and indolent manifestations. Indolent ccRCC is often low-grade 
without necrosis and can be monitored without treatment. Aggressive ccRCC is 
often high-grade and can cause metastasis and death if not promptly detected and 
treated. While most RCCs are detected on computed tomography (CT) scans, 
aggressiveness classification is based on pathology images acquired from 
invasive biopsy orÂ surgery.
PURPOSE: CT imaging-based aggressiveness classification would be an important 
clinical advance, as it would facilitate non-invasive risk stratification and 
treatment planning. Here, we present a novel machine learning method, Correlated 
Feature Aggregation By Region (CorrFABR), for CT-based aggressiveness 
classification ofÂ ccRCC.
METHODS: CorrFABR is a multimodal fusion algorithm that learns from radiology 
and pathology images, and clinical variables in a clinically-relevant manner. 
CorrFABR leverages registration-independent radiology (CT) and pathology image 
correlations using features from vision transformer-based foundation models to 
facilitate aggressiveness assessment on CT images. CorrFABR consists of three 
main steps: (a) Feature aggregation where region-level features are extracted 
from radiology and pathology images at widely varying image resolutions, (b) 
Fusion where radiology features correlated with pathology features 
(pathology-informed CT biomarkers) are learned, and (c) Classification where the 
learned pathology-informed CT biomarkers, together with clinical variables of 
tumor diameter, gender, and age, are used to distinguish aggressive from 
indolent ccRCC using multi-layer perceptron-based classifiers. Pathology images 
are only required in the first two steps of CorrFABR, and are not required in 
the prediction module. Therefore, CorrFABR integrates information from CT 
images, pathology images, and clinical variables during training, but for 
inference, it relies solely on CT images and clinical variables, ensuring its 
clinical applicability. CorrFABR was trained with heterogenous, 
publicly-available data from 298 ccRCC tumors (136 indolent tumors, 162 
aggressive tumors) in a five-fold cross-validation setup and evaluated on an 
independent test set of 74 tumors with a balanced distribution of aggressive and 
indolent tumors. Ablation studies were performed to test the utility of each 
component ofÂ CorrFABR.
RESULTS: CorrFABR outperformed the other classification methods, achieving an 
ROC-AUC (area under the curve) of 0.855Â Â±Â 0.0005 (95% confidence interval: 
0.775, 0.947), F1-score of 0.793Â Â±Â 0.029, sensitivity of 0.741Â Â±Â 0.058, and 
specificity of 0.876Â Â±Â 0.032 in classifying ccRCC as aggressive or indolent 
subtypes. It was found that pathology-informed CT biomarkers learned through 
registration-independent correlation learning improves classification 
performance over using CT features alone, irrespective of the kind of features 
or the classification model used. Tumor diameter, gender, and age provide 
complementary clinical information, and integrating pathology-informed CT 
biomarkers with these clinical variables further improvesÂ performance.
CONCLUSION: CorrFABR provides a novel method for CT-based aggressiveness 
classification of ccRCC by enabling the identification of pathology-informed CT 
biomarkers, and integrating them with clinical variables. CorrFABR enables 
learning of these pathology-informed CT biomarkers through a novel 
registration-independent correlation learning module that considers unaligned 
radiology and pathology images at widely varying imageÂ resolutions.

Implementing Trust in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Diagnosis with a Conformalized 
Uncertainty-Aware AI Framework in Whole-Slide Images.

Zhang X, Wang T, Yan C, Najdawi F, Zhou K, Ma Y, Cheung YM, Malin BA.

Ensuring trustworthiness is fundamental to the development of artificial 
intelligence (AI) that is considered societally responsible, particularly in 
cancer diagnostics, where a misdiagnosis can have dire consequences. Current 
digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness 
concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model 
deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed 
TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in 
non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 
1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope 
inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly 
ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal 
prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the 
framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both 
task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with 
TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of 
classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, 
while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM 
as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse 
architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in 
real-world settings.

BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumors primarily consist of endocrine cells commonly 
located in neural tissue and the endocrine system. Primary neuroendocrine 
neoplasms of the breast are highly heterogeneous tumors characterized by a 
diverse cell population. Their rarity in the breast poses considerable 
challenges in studying their pathogenesis and developing effective treatments.
METHODS: The surgical specimen was obtained from a Chinese female patient 
diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor of the breast (NETB). We performed tissue 
histological staining and established NETB patient-derived organoids, which were 
subsequently used for histological staining, drug screen, and Single-cell RNA 
sequencing.
RESULTS: We successfully established NETB patient-derived organoids from a 
Chinese female patient. Histological staining showed that the morphological 
characteristics and the expression of molecular biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, 
Syn, CgA) in the NETB patient-derived organoids resembled those of the original 
tumor tissue. The NETB patient-derived organoids exhibited varying sensitivities 
to seven different drugs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed significant 
heterogeneity and diverse molecular functions among these organoids.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first instance of establishing an organoid model for 
NETB. Due to high heterogeneity, this NETB patient-derived organoid provides a 
robust foundation for clinical research. In the future, it could serve as a 
reliable tool for disease pathology diagnosis, drug screening, and genetic level 
studies.

Deep learning (DL) holds great promise to improve medical diagnostics, including 
pathology. Current DL research mainly focuses on performance. DL implementation 
potentially leads to environmental consequences but approaches for assessment of 
both performance and carbon footprint are missing. Here, we explored an approach 
for developing DL for pathology, which considers both diagnostic performance and 
carbon footprint, calculated as CO2 or equivalent emissions (CO2eq). We 
evaluated various DL architectures used in computational pathology, including a 
large foundation model, across two diagnostic tasks of low and high complexity. 
We proposed a metric termed 'environmentally sustainable performance' (ESPer), 
which quantitatively integrates performance and operational CO2eq during 
training and inference. While some DL models showed comparable diagnostic 
performance, ESPer enabled prioritizing those with less carbon footprint. We 
also investigated how data reduction approaches can improve the ESPer of 
individual models. This study provides an approach facilitating the development 
of environmentally friendly, sustainable medical AI.

Breast cancer is the leading cancer among women, with a significant number 
experiencing recurrence and metastasis, thereby reducing survival rates. This 
study focuses on the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in breast cancer 
immunotherapy response. We conducted an analysis involving 1027 patients from 
Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas, utilizing RNA sequencing and pathology whole-slide images. We employed 
unsupervised clustering to identify distinct lncRNA expression patterns and 
developed an AI-based pathology model using convolutional neural networks to 
predict immune-metabolic subtypes. Additionally, we created a multimodal model 
integrating lncRNA data, immune-cell scores, clinical information, and pathology 
images for prognostic prediction. Our findings revealed four unique 
immune-metabolic subtypes, and the AI model demonstrated high predictive 
accuracy, highlighting the significant impact of lncRNAs on antitumor immunity 
and metabolic states within the tumor microenvironment. The AI-based pathology 
model, DeepClinMed-IM, exhibited high accuracy in predicting these subtypes. 
Additionally, the multimodal model, DeepClinMed-PGM, integrating pathology 
images, lncRNA data, immune-cell scores, and clinical information, showed 
superior prognostic performance. In conclusion, these AI models provide a robust 
foundation for precise prognostication and the identification of potential 
candidates for immunotherapy, advancing breast cancer research and treatment 
strategies.

PURPOSE: A reliable and comprehensive cancer prognosis model for clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) could better assist in personalizing treatment. In 
this work, we developed a multi-modal ensemble model (MMEM) which integrates 
pretreatment clinical information, multi-omics data, and histopathology whole 
slide image (WSI) data to learn complementary information to predict overall 
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with ccRCC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We collected 226 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma dataset (TCGA-KIRC). These patients have OS 
and DFS follow up data available and five different data modalities provided, 
including clinical information, pathology data in the form of WSI, and three 
multi-omics data, which comprise mRNA expression, miRNA expression (miRSeq), and 
DNA methylation data. Five sets of separate survival prediction models were 
constructed separately for OS and DFS. We used a traditional Cox-proportional 
hazards (CPH) model with iterative forward feature selection for clinical and 
multi-omics data. Four different types of pre-trained encoder models, comprising 
ResNet and three recently developed general purpose foundation models for 
computational pathology, were utilized to extract features from processed WSI 
patches. A deep learning-based CPH model was constructed to predict survival 
outcomes using these encoded WSI features. For each of the survival outcomes of 
interest, we weigh and combine the predicted risk scores from all the five 
models to generate the final prediction. Model weighting was based on the 
training performance. Five-fold cross validation was performed to train and test 
the proposed workflow.
RESULTS: We employed the concordance index (C-index) and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) metrics to assess the performance of our 
models for time-to-event prediction and time-specific binary prediction, 
respectively. Among the sub-models, the clinical feature based CPH model has the 
highest weight for both prediction tasks. For WSI-based prediction, the encoded 
feature using an image-based general purpose foundation model (UNI) showed the 
best prediction performance over other pretrained feature encoders. Our final 
model outperformed corresponding single-modality models on all prediction 
labels, achieving C-indices of 0.820 and 0.833 for OS and DFS, respectively. The 
AUROC values for binary prediction at follow-up of 3 year were 0.831 and 0.862 
for patient death and cancer recurrence, respectively. Using the medians of 
predicted risks as thresholds to identify high-risk and low-risk patient groups, 
we performed log-rank tests, which revealed improved performance in both OS and 
DFS compared to single-modality models.
CONCLUSION: We developed the first multi-modal prediction model MMEM for ccRCC 
patients that integrates features across five different data modalities. Our 
model demonstrated better prognostic ability compared with corresponding 
single-modality models for both prediction targets. If findings are 
independently reproduced, it has the potential to assist in management of ccRCC 
patients.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that can cause lethal disease in 
immunocompromised patients. Immunocompetent host immune responses, such as 
formation of pulmonary granulomas, control the infection and prevent 
disseminated disease. Little is known about the immunological conditions 
establishing the latent infection granuloma in the lungs. To investigate this, 
we performed an analysis of pulmonary immune cell populations, cytokine changes, 
and granuloma formation during infection with a latent disease-causing clinical 
isolate in C3HeB/FeJ mice over 360 days. We found that latently infected mice 
progress through three phases of granuloma formation where different immune 
profiles dominate: an early phase characterized by eosinophilia, high 
IL-4/IL-13, and C. neoformans proliferation in the lungs; an intermediate phase 
characterized by multinucleated giant cell formation, high IL-1Î±/IFNÎ³, granuloma 
expansion, and increased blood antigen levels; and a late phase characterized by 
a significant expansion of T cells, granuloma condensation, and decreases in 
lung fungal burden and blood antigen levels. These findings highlight a complex 
series of immune changes that occur during the establishment of granulomas that 
control C. neoformans in the lungs and lay the foundation for studies to 
identify critical beneficial immune responses to Cryptococcus infections.
IMPORTANCE: Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that disseminates from 
the lungs to the brain to cause fatal disease. Latent C . neoformans infection 
in the lungs is controlled by organized collections of immune cells called 
granulomas. The formation and structure of Cryptococcus granulomas are poorly 
understood due to inconsistent human pathology results and disagreement between 
necrotic granuloma-forming rat models and non-necrotic granuloma-forming mouse 
models. To overcome this, we investigated granuloma formation during latent C. 
neoformans infection in the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain which forms necrotic lung 
granulomas in response to other pathogens. We found that latent C. neoformans 
granuloma formation progresses through phases that we described as early, 
intermediate, and late with different immune response profiles and granulomatous 
characteristics. Ultimately, we show that C3HeB/FeJ mice latently infected with 
C. neoformans form non-necrotic granulomas and could provide a novel mouse model 
to investigate host immune response profiles.

BACKGROUND: Hericium erinaceus mycelium and its constituents, erinacines A and 
S, have shown neuroprotective effects in APP/PS1 transgenic mice; however, the 
precise mechanisms by which they modulate microglial phenotypes remain unclear. 
Our study is the first to explore the effect of erinacines on microglia 
morphology and the underlying mechanisms using a novel primary mixed glia cell 
model and advanced bioinformatic tools. Furthermore, we emphasize the clinical 
relevance by evaluating erinacines in a metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mouse 
model, which more accurately reflects the complexities of human Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), where metabolic syndrome is a common comorbidity.
METHODS: Rat primary mixed glial cultures were used to simulate the spectrum of 
microglial phenotypes, particularly the transition from immature to mature 
states. Microarray sequencing, along with Connectivity Map, ConsensusPathDB, and 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, identified pathways influenced by erinacines. The 
therapeutic efficacy was further evaluated in metabolically stressed APP/PS1 
mice.
RESULTS: Erinacines significantly promoted the development of a ramified, 
neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Bioinformatics revealed potential 
modulation of microglia via histone deacetylase inhibition, actin filament 
dynamics, and synaptic structure modification-pathways not previously linked to 
erinacines in AD. Importantly, erinacines significantly lower fasting blood 
glucose and insulin levels while reducing amyloid-beta plaque burden, 
suppressing hyperactivated glial responses, and enhancing neurogenesis in the 
metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the dual action of erinacines in modulating 
microglia morphology and phenotype while providing neuroprotection in a model 
that closely mimic the complexities of human Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, 
this study provides the foundation for understanding the potential mechanisms of 
action of erinacines, highlighting their promise as a novel treatment approach 
for Alzheimer's, particularly in cases complicated by metabolic dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition of the 
digestive tract with limited therapeutic options. Bitter taste receptors 
(TAS2Rs) and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) are implicated in 
modulating inflammatory responses. Berberine (BBR) and evodiamine (EVO) are 
known to activate TAS2Rs and TRPV1, respectively. However, whether BBR and EVO 
can ameliorate GERD by targeting TAS2Rs and TRPV1 remains uncertain.
PURPOSE: This study aims to determine whether BBR and EVO mitigate esophageal 
injury by targeting TAS2R38 and TRPV1 and to elucidate their underlying 
molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: A GERD rat model was developed using esophagogastric anastomosis, while 
GERD in human esophageal epithelial cells (HEECs) was induced via bile acid (BA) 
exposure. Esophageal pathology was analyzed through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) 
staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). mRNA and protein levels 
were measured via qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western 
blot analysis. Small interfering RNA was used to silence TAS2R38 and TRPV1 in 
HEECs. The activation of TAS2R38 and TRPV1 by BBR and EVO was assessed through 
Ca2+ mobilization assays. Finally, in vivo validation was conducted using U73122 
to inhibit TAS2Rs and resiniferatoxin (RTX) to ablate TRPV1.
RESULTS: BBR and EVO treatments significantly improved esophageal pathology in 
GERD rats and reduced BA-induced inflammation in HEECs. Additionally, BBR and 
EVO suppressed proinflammatory factors expression, upregulated barrier proteins 
such as E-cadherin and claudin-1, and inhibited the phosphorylation of p65, JNK, 
and ERK in the MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways in both in vivo and in vitro 
models. Furthermore, BBR and EVO, whether individually or in combination, 
reduced dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), increased desmosome numbers, and 
modulated macrophage polarization in GERD rats. Knockdown of TAS2R38 and TRPV1 
in HEECs notably diminished the stimulatory effects of BBR and EVO. Moreover, 
the regulation of barrier function and MAPK/NF-ÎºB pathway proteins by BBR and 
EVO in BA-induced HEECs was abrogated upon TAS2R38 and TRPV1 knockdown. 
Similarly, U73122 and RTX reversed the effects of BBR and EVO on macrophage 
polarization and MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways in vivo.
CONCLUSION: We firstly demonstrate that BBR and EVO alleviate GERD, with 
enhanced synergistic efficacy observed when used in combination. 
Mechanistically, BBR and EVO activate the TAS2R38 and TRPV1, respectively, 
leading to downregulation of phosphorylation in MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways 
and modulation of macrophage polarization. These findings offer a novel 
foundation for the clinical application of BBR and EVO in GERD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis is a challenging clinical problem with lung 
pathology featuring immune cell infiltrates, fibroblast expansion, and matrix 
deposition. Molecular analysis of diseased lungs and preclinical models have 
uncovered C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)+Â monocyte egress from the bone 
marrow into the lung, where they acquire profibrotic activities. Current drug 
treatment is focused on fibroblast activity. Alternatively, therapeutic 
targeting and monitoring CCR2+ cells may be an effective patient management 
strategy.
METHODS: Inhibition of CCR2+ cells and, as a benchmark, the clinical 
antifibrotic agent, nintedanib, were used in mouse lung fibrosis models. Lungs 
were evaluated directly for CCR2+ cell infiltration and by non-invasive CCR2+ 
positron emission tomography imaging (CCR2-PET).
FINDINGS: Lung CCR2+ cells were significantly elevated in the bleomycin model as 
determined by tissue evaluation and CCR2-PET imaging. A protective treatment 
protocol with an oral CCR2 inhibitor was compared to oral nintedanib. While we 
expected disparate effects on CCR2+ cells, each drug similarly decreased lung 
CCR2+ cells and fibrosis. Chemotaxis assays showed nintedanib indirectly 
inhibited C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2)-mediated migration of CCR2+ cells. Even 
delayed therapeutic administration of nintedanib in bleomycin and the silicosis 
progressive fibrosis models decreased the accumulation of CCR2+ lung cells. In 
these treatments early CCR2-PET imaging predicted the later development of 
fibrosis.
INTERPRETATION: The inhibition of CCR2+ cell egress is likely a critical 
controller for stabilising lung fibrosis, as provided by nintedanib. Imaging 
with CCR2-PET may be useful to monitor nintedanib treatment responses, guide 
decision-making in the treatment of patients with progressive pulmonary 
fibrosis, and as a biomarker for drug development.

BACKGROUND: The health of migrants and refugees is a key component in achieving 
Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This paper aims to assess the scale of 
financing mobilized by the Moroccan government for migrants and refugees health, 
and addressing health issues related to these populations within the ongoing 
health reforms.
METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to estimate the financial 
resources allocated by the government for migrants' and refugees' healthcare. A 
bottom-up approach was used to assess the unit costs of all services provided 
across five primary healthcare (PHC) centers and three hospitals in two regions 
of Morocco. A detailed costing methodology was applied, accounting for all cost 
components at the health facility level, including depreciation of capital 
assets. By combining unit costs and service volumes, we estimated the total 
government expenditure on healthcare for migrants and refugees. As the free 
service provision shifts to a third-party payment system with the expansion of 
health insurance, this financing must be accounted for. To better prepare for 
future contracting, we also calculated the disease-specific costs for migrants 
and refugees using activity-based costing (ABC) methods, which allowed us to 
develop a database of costs per disease associated with migrant and refugee 
healthcare. Data from 2022 were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: The study found that the government mobilizes approximately 5% of its 
total annual primary healthcare budget for migrants and refugees, amounting to 
$141,652.66. For secondary-level care, the cost was $184,921.92 (3% of total 
hospital costs) for one hospital, $46,778.20 (0.37% of the total cost) for a 
second hospital, and $78,193.53 for a teaching hospital. These findings are 
crucial for informing the development of alternative financing mechanisms 
following the expansion of health insurance coverage, with the cost per 
pathology serving as a foundation for designing these mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: The study also highlighted that hospitals across different levels of 
care manage costly diseases, further underscoring the importance of government 
investment in migrant and refugee healthcare. The nondiscriminatory access to 
healthcare services and the model of care established in Morocco could serve as 
a foundation for developing sustainable healthcare financing models for migrants 
and refugees.

Medical image classification requires labeled, task-specific datasets which are 
used to train deep learning networks de novo, or to fine-tune foundation models. 
However, this process is computationally and technically demanding. In language 
processing, in-context learning provides an alternative, where models learn from 
within prompts, bypassing the need for parameter updates. Yet, in-context 
learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis. Here, we 
systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with 
Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning 
on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of 
tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor 
detection in lymph node sections. Our results show that in-context learning is 
sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for 
particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples. In summary, 
this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain 
specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing 
tasks in histopathology. This democratizes access of generalist AI models to 
medical experts without technical background especially for areas where 
annotated data is scarce.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a chronic disease characterized by decreased 
bone mass, loss of skeletal structural integrity and increased susceptibility to 
fracture. Available studies have shown that the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 
(PDK) family is associated with osteoclastogenesis and bone loss, but the 
specific role of Pdk3 in bone pathology has not been systematically 
investigated.
METHODS: A cell OP model was established in receptor activator for nuclear 
factor-ÎºB Ligand (RANKL)-induced bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Hereafter, the 
expression levels of Pdk3 and osteoclastogenesis feature genes including nuclear 
factor of activated T cells 1 (Nfatc1), Cathepsin K (Ctsk), osteoclast 
associated Ig-like receptor (Oscar) in BMMs-derived osteoclasts were examined 
based on real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting methods. Further, the 
phosphorylation of ERK, P65 and JAK/STAT and their correlation was Pdk3 was 
gauged. In particular, changes in the activity of these signaling pathways were 
observed by silencing experiments of the Pdk3 gene (using small interfering 
RNA). Finally, the effects of Pdk3 gene silencing on signaling pathway activity, 
osteoclastogenesis, and related inflammatory and apoptotic indicators were 
observed by transfection with PDK3-specific siRNA.
RESULTS: Following RANKL exposure, the levels of Pdk3 and osteoclastogenesis 
feature genes were all elevated, and a positive correlation between Pdk3 and 
osteoclastogenesis feature genes was seen. Meanwhile, ERK, P65 and JAK/STAT 
phosphorylation was increased by RANKL, and Pdk3 was confirmed to be positively 
correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK, P65 and JAK/STAT. Additionally, in 
RANKL-exposed osteoclasts, Pdk3 knockdown diminished the phosphorylation of ERK, 
P65 and JAK/STAT, reduced the expressions of osteoclastogenesis feature genes. 
Importantly, knockdown of Pdk3 also reduced the expression of inflammatory 
cytokines and resulted in elevated levels of Bax and Casp3 expression, as well 
as downregulation of Bcl2 expression.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals for the first time the role of Pdk3 in 
RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and OP. These findings provide a foundation for 
future studies on the role of Pdk3 in other bone diseases and provide new ideas 
for the development of OP therapeutics targeting Pdk3.

Panoramic image segmentation in computational pathology presents a remarkable 
challenge due to the morphologically complex and variably scaled anatomy. For 
instance, the intricate organization in kidney pathology spans multiple layers, 
from regions like the cortex and medulla to functional units such as glomeruli, 
tubules, and vessels, down to various cell types. In this paper, we propose a 
novel Hierarchical Adaptive Taxonomy Segmentation (HATs) method, which is 
designed to thoroughly segment panoramic views of kidney structures by 
leveraging detailed anatomical insights. Our approach entails (1) the innovative 
HATs technique which translates spatial relationships among 15 distinct object 
classes into a versatile "plug-and-play" loss function that spans across 
regions, functional units, and cells, (2) the incorporation of anatomical 
hierarchies and scale considerations into a unified simple matrix representation 
for all panoramic entities, (3) the adoption of the latest AI foundation model 
(EfficientSAM) as a feature extraction tool to boost the model's adaptability, 
yet eliminating the need for manual prompt generation in conventional segment 
anything model (SAM). Experimental findings demonstrate that the HATs method 
offers an efficient and effective strategy for integrating clinical insights and 
imaging precedents into a unified segmentation model across more than 15 
categories. The official implementation is publicly available at 
https://github.com/hrlblab/HATs.

BACKGROUND: Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a severe 
fungal superinfection in critically ill influenza patients that is of 
incompletely understood pathogenesis. Despite the use of contemporary therapies 
with antifungal and antivirals, mortality rates remain unacceptably high. We 
aimed to unravel the IAPA immunopathogenesis as a means to develop adjunctive 
immunomodulatory therapies.
METHODS: We used a murine model of IAPA to investigate how influenza predisposes 
to the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Immunocompetent mice 
were challenged with an intranasal instillation of influenza on day 0 followed 
by an orotracheal inoculation with Aspergillus 4 days later. Mice were monitored 
daily for overall health status, lung pathology with micro-computed tomography 
(Î¼CT) and fungal burden with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). At endpoint, high 
parameter immunophenotyping, spatial transcriptomics, histopathology, dynamic 
phagosome biogenesis assays with live imaging, immunofluorescence staining, 
specialized functional phagocytosis and killing assays were performed.
FINDINGS: We uncovered an early exuberant influenza-induced interferon-gamma 
(IFN-Î³) production as the major driver of immunopathology in IAPA and delineated 
the molecular mechanisms. Specifically, excessive IFN-Î³ production resulted in a 
defective Th17-immune response, depletion of macrophages, and impaired killing 
of Aspergillus conidia by macrophages due to the inhibition of NADPH 
oxidase-dependent activation of LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). Markedly, 
mice with partial or complete genetic ablation of IFN-Î³ had a restored 
Th17-immune response, LAP-dependent mechanism of killing and were fully 
protected from invasive fungal infection.
INTERPRETATION: Together, these results identify exuberant viral induced IFN-Î³ 
production as a major driver of immune dysfunction in IAPA, paving the way to 
explore the use of excessive viral-induced IFN-Î³ as a biomarker and new 
immunotherapeutic target in IAPA.

BACKGROUND: Mouse models that recapitulate key features of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are important tools 
for understanding complex interactions between host genetics, immune responses, 
and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Little is known about how predominantly cellular 
(Th1 type) versus humoral (Th2 type) immune responses influence SARS-CoV-2 
dynamics, including infectivity and disease course.
METHODS: We generated knock-in (KI) mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) and/or 
human TMPRSS2 (hTMPRSS2) on Th1-biased (C57BL/6; B6) and Th2-biased (BALB/c) 
genetic backgrounds. Mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 Delta 
(B.1.617.2) or Omicron BA.1 (B.1.1.529) variants, followed by assessment of 
disease course, respiratory tract infection, lung histopathology, and humoral 
and cellular immune responses.
FINDINGS: In both B6 and BALB/c mice, hACE2 expression was required for 
infection of the lungs with Delta, but not Omicron BA.1. Disease severity was 
greater in Omicron BA.1-infected hTMPRSS2-KI and double-KI BALB/c mice compared 
with B6 mice, and in Delta-infected double-KI B6 and BALB/c mice compared with 
hACE2-KI mice. hACE2-KI B6 mice developed more severe lung pathology and more 
robust SARS-CoV-2-specific splenic CD8 T cell responses compared with hACE2-KI 
BALB/c mice. There were no notable differences between the two genetic 
backgrounds in plasma cell, germinal center B cell, or antibody responses to 
SARS-CoV-2.
INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron BA.1 infection, disease course, and 
CD8 T cell response are influenced by the host genetic background. These 
humanized mice hold promise as important tools for investigating the mechanisms 
underlying the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and immune 
response.

Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and 
subtype classification. Standard artificial intelligence methods for 
histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for 
each diagnostic task1,2. Although such methods have achieved some success, they 
often have limited generalizability to images generated by different 
digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations3. Here, 
to address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging 
Evaluation Foundation (CHIEF) model, a general-purpose weakly supervised machine 
learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for systematic cancer 
evaluation. CHIEF leverages two complementary pretraining methods to extract 
diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level 
feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern 
recognition. We developed CHIEF using 60,530 whole-slide images spanning 19 
anatomical sites. Through pretraining on 44 terabytes of high-resolution 
pathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted microscopic representations useful 
for cancer cell detection, tumour origin identification, molecular profile 
characterization and prognostic prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF 
using 19,491 whole-slide images from 32 independent slide sets collected from 24 
hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the 
state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1%, showing its ability to 
address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed 
by different slide preparation methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable 
foundation for efficient digital pathology evaluation for patients with cancer.

The analysis of histopathology images with artificial intelligence aims to 
enable clinical decision support systems and precision medicine. The success of 
such applications depends on the ability to model the diverse patterns observed 
in pathology images. To this end, we present Virchow, the largest foundation 
model for computational pathology to date. In addition to the evaluation of 
biomarker prediction and cell identification, we demonstrate that a large 
foundation model enables pan-cancer detection, achieving 0.95 specimen-level 
area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve across nine common and 
seven rare cancers. Furthermore, we show that with less training data, the 
pan-cancer detector built on Virchow can achieve similar performance to 
tissue-specific clinical-grade models in production and outperform them on some 
rare variants of cancer. Virchow's performance gains highlight the value of a 
foundation model and open possibilities for many high-impact applications with 
limited amounts of labeled training data.

Studies on the pathophysiology of shoulder contracture and development of 
interventions have greatly benefited from the use of animal models. This 
narrative review comprehensively analyzes research on established rat model of 
shoulder contracture and new treatment approaches. This review evaluated 
existing literature on the available techniques for inducing contracture models, 
assessed these models, conducted pathological analyses, and explored their 
application in developing new treatment interventions. Our review highlights the 
usefulness of different rat shoulder contracture models, including external 
immobilization, internal immobilization, and intra-articular injection models, 
each with varying levels of success. Pathological analyses have demonstrated 
similarities to the human condition. The effective models have been instrumental 
in developing new treatment interventions, including recombinant human 
relaxin-2, platelet-rich plasma, collagenase clostridium histolyticum, and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ agonists. Therefore, rat shoulder 
contracture models serve as valuable tools for researchers to establish an 
effective animal model foundation for investigating the etiology and potential 
treatment.

The main bottleneck in training a robust tumor segmentation algorithm for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on H&E is generating sufficient ground truth 
annotations. Various approaches for generating tumor labels to train a tumor 
segmentation model was explored. A large dataset of low-cost low-accuracy 
panCK-based annotations was used to pre-train the model and determine the 
minimum required size of theÂ expensive but highly accurate pathologist 
annotations dataset. PanCK pre-training was compared to foundation models and 
various architectures were explored for model backbone. Proper study design and 
sample procurement for training a generalizable model that captured variations 
in NSCLC H&E was studied. H&E imaging was performed on 112 samples (three 
centers, two scanner types, different staining and imaging protocols). Attention 
U-Net architecture was trained using the large panCK-based annotations dataset 
(68 samples, total area 10,326 [mm2]) followed by fine-tuning using a small 
pathologist annotations dataset (80 samples, total area 246 [mm2]). This 
approach resulted in mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 82% [77 87]. Using 
panCK pretraining provided better performance compared to foundation models and 
allowed for 70% reduction in pathologist annotations with no drop in 
performance. Study design ensured model generalizability over variations on H&E 
where performance was consistent across centers, scanners, and subtypes.

GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the 
accumulation of GM1 ganglioside, leading to severe neurodegeneration and early 
mortality. The disease primarily affects the central nervous system, causing 
progressive neurodegeneration, including widespread neuronal loss and gliosis. 
To gain a deeper understanding of the neuropathology associated with GM1 
gangliosidosis, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyze brain 
tissues from both GM1 gangliosidosis model mice and control mice. No significant 
changes in cell proportions were detected between the two groups of animals. 
Differential expression analysis revealed cell type-specific changes in gene 
expression in neuronal and glial cells. Functional analysis highlighted the 
neurodegenerative processes, oxidative phosphorylation, and neuroactive 
ligand-receptor interactions as the significantly affected pathways. The 
contribution of the impairment of neurotransmitter system disruption and 
neuronal circuitry disruption was more important than neuroinflammatory 
responses to GM1 pathology. In 16-week-old GM1 gangliosidosis mice, no 
microglial or astrocyte activation or increased expression of innate immunity 
genes was detected. This suggested that nerve degeneration did not induce the 
inflammatory response but rather promoted glial cell clearance. Our findings 
provide a crucial foundation for understanding the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of GM1 gangliosidosis, potentially guiding future therapeutic 
strategies.

Pathological complete response (pCR) serves as a critical measure of the success 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer, directly influencing 
subsequent therapeutic decisions. With the continuous advancement of artificial 
intelligence, methods for early and accurate prediction of pCR are being 
extensively explored. In this study, we propose a cross-modal multi-pathway 
automated prediction model that integrates temporal and spatial information. 
This model fuses digital pathology images from biopsy specimens and 
multi-temporal ultrasound (US) images to predict pCR status early in NAC. The 
model demonstrates exceptional predictive efficacy. Our findings lay the 
foundation for developing personalized treatment paradigms based on individual 
responses. This approach has the potential to become a critical auxiliary tool 
for the early prediction of NAC response in breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Deployment and access to state-of-the-art precision medicine 
technologies remains a fundamental challenge in providing equitable global 
cancer care in low-resource settings. The expansion of digital pathology in 
recent years and its potential interface with diagnostic artificial intelligence 
algorithms provides an opportunity to democratize access to personalized 
medicine. Current digital pathology workstations, however, cost thousands to 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. As cancer incidence rises in many low- and 
middle-income countries, the validation and implementation of low-cost automated 
diagnostic tools will be crucial to helping healthcare providers manage the 
growing burden of cancer.
METHODS: Here we describe a low-cost ($230) workstation for digital slide 
capture and computational analysis composed of open-source components. We 
analyze the predictive performance of deep learning models when they are used to 
evaluate pathology images captured using this open-source workstation versus 
images captured using common, significantly more expensive hardware. Validation 
studies assessed model performance on three distinct datasets and predictive 
models: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV positive versus HPV 
negative), lung cancer (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma), and 
breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma versus invasive lobular carcinoma).
FINDINGS: When compared to traditional pathology image capture methods, low-cost 
digital slide capture and analysis with the open-source workstation, including 
the low-cost microscope device, was associated with model performance of 
comparable accuracy for breast, lung, and HNSCC classification. At the patient 
level of analysis, AUROC was 0.84 for HNSCC HPV status prediction, 1.0 for lung 
cancer subtype prediction, and 0.80 for breast cancer classification.
INTERPRETATION: Our ability to maintain model performance despite decreased 
image quality and low-power computational hardware demonstrates that it is 
feasible to massively reduce costs associated with deploying deep learning 
models for digital pathology applications. Improving access to cutting-edge 
diagnostic tools may provide an avenue for reducing disparities in cancer care 
between high- and low-income regions.

BACKGROUND: Although WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) mutations have been linked to Î² 
-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), the precise molecular 
and cellular mechanisms behind this disease remain elusive. This study aims to 
shed light on the impacts of WDR45-deficiency on neurodegeneration, specifically 
axonal degeneration, within the midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) system. We hope 
to better understand the disease process by examining pathological and molecular 
alterations, especially within the DAergic system.
METHODS: To investigate the impacts of WDR45 dysfunction on mouse behaviors and 
DAergic neurons, we developed a mouse model in which WDR45 was conditionally 
knocked out in the midbrain DAergic neurons (WDR45cKO). Through a longitudinal 
study, we assessed alterations in the mouse behaviors using open field, rotarod, 
Y-maze, and 3-chamber social approach tests. We utilized a combination of 
immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy to examine the 
pathological changes in DAergic neuron soma and axons. Additionally, we 
performed proteomic and lipidomic analyses of the striatum from young and aged 
mice to identify the molecules and processes potentially involved in the 
striatal pathology during aging. Further more, primary midbrain neuronal culture 
was employed to explore the molecular mechanisms leading to axonal degeneration.
RESULTS: Our study of WDR45cKO mice revealed a range of deficits, including 
impaired motor function, emotional instability, and memory loss, coinciding with 
the profound reduction of midbrain DAergic neurons. The neuronal loss, we 
observed massive axonal enlargements in the dorsal and ventral striatum. These 
enlargements were characterized by the accumulation of extensively fragmented 
tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a hallmark of axonal degeneration. Proteomic 
analysis of the striatum showed that the differentially expressed proteins were 
enriched in metabolic processes. The carbohydrate metabolic and protein 
catabolic processes appeared earlier, and amino acid, lipid, and tricarboxylic 
acid metabolisms were increased during aging. Of note, we observed a tremendous 
increase in the expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (Lpcat1) 
that regulates phospholipid metabolism, specifically in the conversion of 
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the presence of 
acyl-CoA. The lipidomic results consistently suggested that differential lipids 
were concentrated on PC and LPC. Axonal degeneration was effectively ameliorated 
by interfering Lpcat1 expression in primary cultured WDR45-deficient DAergic 
neurons, proving that Lpcat1 and its regulated lipid metabolism, especially PC 
and LPC metabolism, participate in controlling the axonal degeneration induced 
by WDR45 deficits.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
contribution of WDR45 deficiency to axonal degeneration, which involves complex 
relationships between phospholipid metabolism, autophagy, and tubular ER. These 
findings greatly advance our understanding of the fundamental molecular 
mechanisms driving axonal degeneration and may provide a foundation for 
developing novel mechanistically based therapeutic interventions for BPAN and 
other neurodegenerative diseases.

PURPOSE: This study delves into the hemodynamic characteristics of 
Vertebrobasilar Artery Fenestration (VBAF) combined with Vertebrobasilar 
Dolichoectasia (VBD) using Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). By summarizing 
the hemodynamic features and identifying high-risk populations, we aim to 
provide insights for clinical treatment.
METHODS: Utilizing MRA images as a foundation, arterial three-dimensional 
geometric models were constructed. A total of 22 cases were categorized into 
control, S, L, U, and Spiral groups, and numerical simulation analysis of the 
vessels was conducted using computational fluid dynamics methods.
RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters of the VBAF combined with the VBD model were 
obtained, including blood flow velocity, oscillatory shear stress (OSI), wall 
shear stress (WSS), and aneurysm formation indicator (AFI). The V, OSI, and WSS 
indices of the L, U, and Spiral groups were significantly higher than those of 
the control group (P < 0.05). High-speed blood flow, elevated WSS, and increased 
OSI in these groups were concentrated at the fenestration site, with scattered 
distribution along the tortuous vertebral artery and basilar artery segments, 
accompanied by significant differences in the parameters of the bilateral 
vertebral arteries.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary investigation identifies the L, U, and Spiral 
groups as high-risk populations. Abnormal hemodynamics may lead to a vicious 
cycle in vascular wall pathology, increasing the likelihood of adverse events 
such as cerebral infarction. Clinical attention should focus on individuals 
within these groups and their corresponding vascular regions.

Accurate and scalable quantification of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) pathology is crucial for 
deeper disease phenotyping and furthering research in Alzheimer Disease (AD). 
This multidisciplinary study addresses the current limitations on neuropathology 
by leveraging a machine learning (ML) pipeline to perform a granular 
quantification of AÎ² deposits and assess their distribution in the temporal 
lobe. Utilizing 131 whole-slide-images from consecutive autopsied cases at the 
University of California Davis Alzheimer Disease Research Center, our objectives 
were threefold: (1) Validate an automatic workflow for AÎ² deposit quantification 
in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM); (2) define the distributions of 
different AÎ² deposit types in GM and WM, and (3) investigate correlates of AÎ² 
deposits with dementia status and the presence of mixed pathology. Our 
methodology highlights the robustness and efficacy of the ML pipeline, 
demonstrating proficiency akin to experts' evaluations. We provide comprehensive 
insights into the quantification and distribution of AÎ² deposits in the temporal 
GM and WM revealing a progressive increase in tandem with the severity of 
established diagnostic criteria (NIA-AA). We also present correlations of AÎ² 
load with clinical diagnosis as well as presence/absence of mixed pathology. 
This study introduces a reproducible workflow, showcasing the practical use of 
ML approaches in the field of neuropathology, and use of the output data for 
correlative analyses. Acknowledging limitations, such as potential biases in the 
ML model and current ML classifications, we propose avenues for future research 
to refine and expand the methodology. We hope to contribute to the broader 
landscape of neuropathology advancements, ML applications, and precision 
medicine, paving the way for deep phenotyping of AD brain cases and establishing 
a foundation for further advancements in neuropathological research.

BACKGROUND: The density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be 
prognostic in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, manual TIL 
quantification is time-consuming and suffers from interobserver and 
intraobserver variability. In this study, we developed a TIL-based computational 
pathology biomarker and evaluated its association with the risk of recurrence 
and benefit of adjuvant treatment in a clinical trial cohort.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a computational pathology pipeline 
was developed to generate a TIL-based biomarker (CPath TIL categories). 
Subsequently, the signature underwent a masked independent validation on 
H&E-stained whole-section images of 755 patients with DCIS from the UK/ANZ DCIS 
randomised controlled trial. Specifically, continuous biomarker CPath TIL score 
was calculated as the average TIL density in the DCIS microenvironment and 
dichotomised into binary biomarker CPath TIL categories (CPath TIL-high vs CPath 
TIL-low) using the median value as a cutoff. The primary outcome was ipsilateral 
breast event (IBE; either recurrence of DCIS [DCIS-IBE] or invasive progression 
[I-IBE]). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard 
ratio (HR).
FINDINGS: CPath TIL-score was evaluable in 718 (95%) of 755 patients (151 IBEs). 
Patients with CPath TIL-high DCIS had a greater risk of IBE than those with 
CPath TIL-low DCIS (HR 2Â·10 [95% CI 1Â·39-3Â·18]; p=0Â·0004). The risk of I-IBE was 
greater in patients with CPath TIL-high DCIS than those with CPath TIL-low DCIS 
(3Â·09 [1Â·56-6Â·14]; p=0Â·0013), and the risk of DCIS-IBE was non-significantly 
higher in those with CPath TIL-high DCIS (1Â·61 [0Â·95-2Â·72]; p=0Â·077). A 
significant interaction (pinteraction=0Â·025) between CPath TIL categories and 
radiotherapy was observed with a greater magnitude of radiotherapy benefit in 
preventing IBE in CPath TIL-high DCIS (0Â·32 [0Â·19-0Â·54]) than CPath TIL-low DCIS 
(0Â·40 [0Â·20-0Â·81]).
INTERPRETATION: High TIL density is associated with higher recurrence 
risk-particularly of invasive recurrence-and greater radiotherapy benefit in 
patients with DCIS. Our TIL-based computational pathology signature has a 
prognostic and predictive role in DCIS.

Recent advances in foundation models have revolutionized model development in 
digital pathology, reducing dependence on extensive manual annotations required 
by traditional methods. The ability of foundation models to generalize well with 
few-shot learning addresses critical barriers in adapting models to diverse 
medical imaging tasks. This work presents the Granular Box Prompt Segment 
Anything Model (GB-SAM), an improved version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 
fine-tuned using granular box prompts with limited training data. The GB-SAM 
aims to reduce the dependency on expert pathologist annotators by enhancing the 
efficiency of the automated annotation process. Granular box prompts are small 
box regions derived from ground truth masks, conceived to replace the 
conventional approach of using a single large box covering the entire 
H&E-stained image patch. This method allows a localized and detailed analysis of 
gland morphology, enhancing the segmentation accuracy of individual glands and 
reducing the ambiguity that larger boxes might introduce in morphologically 
complex regions. We compared the performance of our GB-SAM model against U-Net 
trained on different sizes of the CRAG dataset. We evaluated the models across 
histopathological datasets, including CRAG, GlaS, and Camelyon16. GB-SAM 
consistently outperformed U-Net, with reduced training data, showing less 
segmentation performance degradation. Specifically, on the CRAG dataset, GB-SAM 
achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.885 compared to U-Net's 0.857 when trained on 
25% of the data. Additionally, GB-SAM demonstrated segmentation stability on the 
CRAG testing dataset and superior generalization across unseen datasets, 
including challenging lymph node segmentation in Camelyon16, which achieved a 
Dice coefficient of 0.740 versus U-Net's 0.491. Furthermore, compared to 
SAM-Path and Med-SAM, GB-SAM showed competitive performance. GB-SAM achieved a 
Dice score of 0.900 on the CRAG dataset, while SAM-Path achieved 0.884. On the 
GlaS dataset, Med-SAM reported a Dice score of 0.956, whereas GB-SAM achieved 
0.885 with significantly less training data. These results highlight GB-SAM's 
advanced segmentation capabilities and reduced dependency on large datasets, 
indicating its potential for practical deployment in digital pathology, 
particularly in settings with limited annotated datasets.

Recent medical literature shows that the application of artificial intelligence 
(AI) models in gastrointestinal pathology is an exponentially growing field, 
with promising models that show very high performances. Regarding inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), recent reviews demonstrate promising diagnostic and 
prognostic AI models. However, studies are generally at high risk of bias 
(especially in AI models that are image-based). The creation of specific AI 
models that improve diagnostic performance and allow the establishment of a 
general prognostic forecast in IBD is of great interest, as it may allow the 
stratification of patients into subgroups and, in turn, allow the creation of 
different diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for these patients. Regarding 
surgical models, predictive models of postoperative complications have shown 
great potential in large-scale studies. In this work, the authors present the 
development of a predictive algorithm for early post-surgical complications in 
Crohn's disease based on a Random Forest model with exceptional predictive 
ability for complications within the cohort. The present work, based on logical 
and reasoned, clinical, and applicable aspects, lays a solid foundation for 
future prospective work to further develop post-surgical prognostic tools for 
IBD. The next step is to develop in a prospective and multicenter way, a 
collaborative path to optimize this line of research and make it applicable to 
our patients.

The objective of this study is to review different methods to screen for the 
optimal model for preventing and treating chicken glandular and muscular 
gastritis syndrome. Twenty-four 40-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens 
were randomly allocated into four groups (N = 6): polyethylene glycol + ammonium 
chloride group (M1 group), acetic acid + rhubarb group (M2 group), polyethylene 
glycol + rhubarb group (M3 group), and control group. The control group had free 
access to water, while the remaining groups received different doses of molding 
reagents added to their drinking water. The animal models were assessed based on 
clinical manifestations, histopathology findings, serological analysis, and 
composition of intestinal microbiota to establish an optimal approach for 
constructing an avian model of glandular and muscular gastritis. The SPF 
chickens in each model group exhibited typical symptoms of glandular and 
muscular gastritis, poor spirit, yellow loose stools with undigested feed, and 
enlargement and ulceration of the glandular and muscular stomach. Among these 
groups, the M3 group had the highest incidence rate of 100%. Compared to the 
control group, the body weight and body temperature of the chicken in the three 
model groups were reduced, and the glandular and muscular stomachs and duodenum 
showed different degrees of bleeding, mucosal abscission, and other pathological 
injuries. Additionally, the levels of serum IL-2 and Î±-amylase activity 
decreased while the content of IL-4 increased. After conducting 16s rDNA 
sequencing, it was observed that the abundance of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, 
and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 was significantly increased in the model group 
compared to the control group. Conversely, there was a notable decrease in the 
levels of Megamonas and Lactobacillus, which are speculated to be associated 
with arachidonic acid metabolism, the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and TNF signaling 
pathways. The combination of polyethylene glycol and rhubarb emerged as the most 
effective method for establishing the glandular and muscular gastritis model in 
SPF chickens. This constructed chicken model displayed distinct signs of damage 
to the glandular and muscular stomach, inflammatory response, and disturbance in 
the intestinal flora, thereby providing a foundation for future research on the 
prevention and treatment of this syndrome.

Ascariasis, caused by both Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum, is the most 
prevalent parasitic disease worldwide, affecting both human and porcine 
populations. However, due to the difficulties of assessing the early events of 
infection in humans, most studies of human ascariasis have been restricted to 
the chronic intestinal phase. Therefore, the Ascaris mouse model has become a 
fundamental tool for investigating the immunobiology and pathogenesis of the 
early infection stage referred to as larval ascariasis because of the model's 
practicality and ability to replicate the natural processes involved. The 
Ascaris mouse model has been widely used to explore factors such as infection 
resistance/susceptibility, liver inflammation, lung immune-mediated pathology, 
and co-infections and, notably, as a pivotal element in preclinical vaccine 
trials. Exploring the immunobiology of larval ascariasis may offer new insights 
into disease development and provide a substantial understanding of key 
components that trigger a protective immune response. This article focuses on 
creating a comprehensive guide for conducting Ascaris experimental infections in 
the laboratory as a foundation for future research efforts. Â© 2024 Wiley

BACKGROUND: Chest X-rays (CXR) are essential for diagnosing a variety of 
conditions, but when used on new populations, model generalizability issues 
limit their efficacy. Generative AI, particularly denoising diffusion 
probabilistic models (DDPMs), offers a promising approach to generating 
synthetic images, enhancing dataset diversity. This study investigates the 
impact of synthetic data supplementation on the performance and generalizability 
of medical imaging research.
METHODS: The study employed DDPMs to create synthetic CXRs conditioned on 
demographic and pathological characteristics from the CheXpert dataset. These 
synthetic images were used to supplement training datasets for pathology 
classifiers, with the aim of improving their performance. The evaluation 
involved three datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and Emory Chest X-ray) and various 
experiments, including supplementing real data with synthetic data, training 
with purely synthetic data, and mixing synthetic data with external datasets. 
Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve 
(AUROC).
FINDINGS: Adding synthetic data to real datasets resulted in a notable increase 
in AUROC values (up to 0.02 in internal and external test sets with 1000% 
supplementation, p-value <0.01 in all instances). When classifiers were trained 
exclusively on synthetic data, they achieved performance levels comparable to 
those trained on real data with 200%-300% data supplementation. The combination 
of real and synthetic data from different sources demonstrated enhanced model 
generalizability, increasing model AUROC from 0.76 to 0.80 on the internal test 
set (p-value <0.01).
INTERPRETATION: Synthetic data supplementation significantly improves the 
performance and generalizability of pathology classifiers in medical imaging.

Digital pathology poses unique computational challenges, as a standard gigapixel 
slide may comprise tens of thousands of image tiles1-3. Prior models have often 
resorted to subsampling a small portion of tiles for each slide, thus missing 
the important slide-level context4. Here we present Prov-GigaPath, a whole-slide 
pathology foundation model pretrained on 1.3 billion 256âÃâ256 pathology image 
tiles in 171,189 whole slides from Providence, a large US health network 
comprising 28 cancer centres. The slides originated from more than 30,000 
patients covering 31 major tissue types. To pretrain Prov-GigaPath, we propose 
GigaPath, a novel vision transformer architecture for pretraining gigapixel 
pathology slides. To scale GigaPath for slide-level learning with tens of 
thousands of image tiles, GigaPath adapts the newly developed LongNet5 method to 
digital pathology. To evaluate Prov-GigaPath, we construct a digital pathology 
benchmark comprising 9 cancer subtyping tasks and 17 pathomics tasks, using both 
Providence and TCGA data6. With large-scale pretraining and ultra-large-context 
modelling, Prov-GigaPath attains state-of-the-art performance on 25 out of 26 
tasks, with significant improvement over the second-best method on 18 tasks. We 
further demonstrate the potential of Prov-GigaPath on vision-language 
pretraining for pathology7,8 by incorporating the pathology reports. In sum, 
Prov-GigaPath is an open-weight foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art 
performance on various digital pathology tasks, demonstrating the importance of 
real-world data and whole-slide modelling.

PURPOSE: Aortic dissection carries a mortality as high as 50%, but surgical 
palliation is also fraught with morbidity risks of stroke or paralysis. As such, 
a significant focus of medical decision making is on longitudinal aortic 
diameters. We hypothesize that three-dimensional (3D) modeling affords a more 
efficient methodology toward automated longitudinal aortic measurement. The 
first step is to automate the measurement of manually segmented 3D models of the 
aorta. We developed and validated an algorithm to analyze a 3D segmented aorta 
and output the maximum dimension of minimum cross-sectional areas in a stepwise 
progression from the diaphragm to the aortic root. Accordingly, the goal is to 
assess the diagnostic validity of the 3D modeling measurement as a substitute 
for existing 2D measurements.
APPROACH: From January 2021 to June 2022, 66 3D non-contrast steady-state free 
precession magnetic resonance images of aortic pathology with clinical aortic 
measurements were identified; 3D aorta models were manually segmented. A novel 
mathematical algorithm was applied to each model to generate maximal aortic 
diameters from the diaphragm to the root, which were then correlated to clinical 
measurements.
RESULTS: With a 76% success rate, we analyzed the resulting 50 3D aortic models 
utilizing the automated measurement tool. There was an excellent correlation 
between the automated measurement and the clinical measurement. The intra-class 
correlation coefficient and p-value for each of the nine measured locations of 
the aorta were as follows: sinus of valsalva, 0.99, Â <Â 0.001; sino-tubular 
junction, 0.89, Â <Â 0.001; ascending aorta, 0.97, Â <Â 0.001; brachiocephalic 
artery, 0.96, Â <Â 0.001; transverse segment 1, 0.89, Â <Â 0.001; transverse segment 
2, 0.93, Â <Â 0.001; isthmus region, 0.92, Â <Â 0.001; descending aorta, 0.96, 
Â <Â 0.001; and aorta at diaphragm, 0.3, Â <Â 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Automating diagnostic measurements that appease clinical confidence 
is a critical first step in a fully automated process. This tool demonstrates 
excellent correlation between measurements derived from manually segmented 3D 
models and the clinical measurements, laying the foundation for transitioning 
analytic methodologies from 2D to 3D.

BACKGROUND: The pathological examination of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is 
crucial for treating prostate cancer (PCa). However, the limitations with 
naked-eye detection and pathologist workload contribute to a high 
missed-diagnosis rate for nodal micrometastasis. We aimed to develop an 
artificial intelligence (AI)-based, time-efficient, and high-precision PCa LNM 
detector (ProCaLNMD) and evaluate its clinical application value.
METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, diagnostic study, consecutive 
patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node 
dissection at five centres between Sep 2, 2013 and Apr 28, 2023 were included, 
and histopathological slides of resected lymph nodes were collected and 
digitised as whole-slide images for model development and validation. ProCaLNMD 
was trained at a dataset from a single centre (the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital 
of Sun Yat-sen University [SYSMH]), and externally validated in the other four 
centres. A bladder cancer dataset from SYSMH was used to further validate 
ProCaLNMD, and an additional validation (human-AI comparison and collaboration 
study) containing consecutive patients with PCa from SYSMH was implemented to 
evaluate the application value of integrating ProCaLNMD into the clinical 
workflow. The primary endpoint was the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) of ProCaLNMD. In addition, the performance measures 
for pathologists with ProCaLNMD assistance was also assessed.
FINDINGS: In total, 8225 slides from 1297 patients with PCa were collected and 
digitised. Overall, 8158 slides (18,761 lymph nodes) from 1297 patients with PCa 
(median age 68 years [interquartile range 64-73]; 331 [26%] with LNM) were used 
to train and validate ProCaLNMD. The AUROC of ProCaLNMD ranged from 0.975 (95% 
confidence interval 0.953-0.998) to 0.992 (0.982-1.000) in the training and 
validation datasets, with sensitivities > 0.955 and specificities > 0.921. 
ProCaLNMD also demonstrated an AUROC of 0.979 in the cross-cancer dataset. 
ProCaLNMD use triggered true reclassification in 43 (4.3%) slides in which 
micrometastatic tumour regions were initially missed by pathologists, thereby 
correcting 28 (8.5%) missed-diagnosed cases of previous routine pathological 
reports. In the human-AI comparison and collaboration study, the sensitivity of 
ProCaLNMD (0.983 [0.908-1.000]) surpassed that of two junior pathologists (0.862 
[0.746-0.939], PÂ =Â 0.023; 0.879 [0.767-0.950], PÂ =Â 0.041) by 10-12% and showed 
no difference to that of two senior pathologists (both 0.983 [0.908-1.000], both 
PÂ >Â 0.99). Furthermore, ProCaLNMD significantly boosted the diagnostic 
sensitivity of two junior pathologists (both PÂ =Â 0.041) to the level of senior 
pathologists (both PÂ >Â 0.99), and substantially reduced the four pathologists' 
slide reviewing time (-31%, PÂ <Â 0.0001;Â -34%, PÂ <Â 0.0001;Â -29%, PÂ <Â 0.0001; 
andÂ -27%, PÂ =Â 0.00031).
INTERPRETATION: ProCaLNMD demonstrated high diagnostic capabilities for 
identifying LNM in prostate cancer, reducing the likelihood of missed diagnoses 
by pathologists and decreasing the slide reviewing time, highlighting its 
potential for clinical application.

Aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 1 (AGC1) is a carrier responsible for the 
export of mitochondrial aspartate in exchange for cytosolic glutamate and is 
part of the malate-aspartate shuttle, essential for the balance of reducing 
equivalents in the cells. In the brain, mutations in SLC25A12 gene, encoding for 
AGC1, cause an ultra-rare genetic disease, reported as a neurodevelopmental 
encephalopathy, whose symptoms include global hypomyelination, arrested 
psychomotor development, hypotonia and seizures. Among the biological components 
most affected by AGC1 deficiency are oligodendrocytes, glial cells responsible 
for myelination processes, and their precursors [oligodendrocyte progenitor 
cells (OPCs)]. The AGC1 silencing in an in vitro model of OPCs was documented to 
cause defects of proliferation and differentiation, mediated by alterations of 
histone acetylation/deacetylation. Disrupting AGC1 activity could possibly 
reduce the availability of acetyl groups, leading to perturbation of many 
biological pathways, such as histone modifications and fatty acids formation for 
myelin production. Here, we explore the transcriptome of mouse OPCs partially 
silenced for AGC1, reporting results of canonical analyses (differential 
expression) and pathway enrichment analyses, which highlight a disruption in 
fatty acids synthesis from both a regulatory and enzymatic stand. We further 
investigate the cellular effects of AGC1 deficiency through the identification 
of most affected transcriptional networks and altered alternative splicing. 
Transcriptional data were integrated with differential metabolite abundance 
analysis, showing downregulation of several amino acids, including glutamine and 
aspartate. Taken together, our results provide a molecular foundation for the 
effects of AGC1 deficiency in OPCs, highlighting the molecular mechanisms 
affected and providing a list of actionable targets to mitigate the effects of 
this pathology.

Migraine, recognized as a severe headache disorder, is widely prevalent, 
significantly impacting the quality of life for those affected. This article 
aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of animal model 
technologies in unraveling the pathomechanism of migraine and developing more 
effective therapies. It introduces a variety of animal experimental models used 
in migraine research, emphasizing their versatility and importance in simulating 
various aspects of the condition. It details the benefits arising from the 
utilization of these models, emphasizing their role in elucidating pain 
mechanisms, clarifying trigeminal activation, as well as replicating migraine 
symptoms and histological changes. In addition, the article consciously 
acknowledges the inherent limitations and challenges associated with the 
application of animal experimental models. Recognizing these constraints is a 
fundamental step toward fine-tuning and optimizing the models for a more 
accurate reflection of and translatability to the human environment. Overall, a 
detailed and comprehensive understanding of migraine animal models is crucial 
for navigating the complexity of the disease. These findings not only provide a 
deeper insight into the multifaceted nature of migraine but also serve as a 
foundation for developing effective therapeutic strategies that specifically 
address the unique challenges arising from migraine pathology.

Rodent models, such as mice and rats, are commonly used to examine retinal 
ganglion cell damage in eye diseases. However, as nocturnal animals, rodent 
retinal structures differ from primates, imposing significant limitations in 
studying retinal pathology. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) are small, diurnal 
paraprimates that exhibit superior visual acuity and color vision compared with 
mice. Like humans, tree shrews have a dense retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and 
a thick ganglion cell layer (GCL), making them a valuable model for 
investigating optic neuropathies. In this study, we applied high-resolution 
visible-light optical coherence tomography to characterize the tree shrew 
retinal structure in vivo and compare it with that of humans and mice. We 
quantitatively characterize the tree shrew's retinal layer structure in vivo, 
specifically examining the sublayer structures within the inner plexiform layer 
(IPL) for the first time. Next, we conducted a comparative analysis of retinal 
layer structures among tree shrews, mice, and humans. We then validated our in 
vivo findings in the tree shrew inner retina using ex vivo confocal microscopy. 
The in vivo and ex vivo analyses of the shrew retina build the foundation for 
future work to accurately track and quantify the retinal structural changes in 
the IPL, GCL, and RNFL during the development and progression of human optic 
diseases.

Pompe disease (PD) is a progressive myopathy caused by the aberrant accumulation 
of glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle resulting from the deficiency of the 
enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Administration of recombinant human GAA as 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) works well in alleviating the cardiac 
manifestations of PD but loses sustained benefit in ameliorating the skeletal 
muscle pathology. The limited efficacy of ERT in skeletal muscle is partially 
attributable to its inability to curb the accumulation of new glycogen produced 
by the muscle enzyme glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1). Substrate reduction therapies 
aimed at knocking down GYS1 expression represent a promising avenue to improve 
Pompe myopathy. However, finding specific inhibitors for GYS1 is challenging 
given the presence of the highly homologous GYS2 in the liver. Antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs) are chemically modified oligomers that hybridize to 
their complementary target RNA to induce their degradation with exquisite 
specificity. In the present study, we show that ASO-mediated Gys1 knockdown in 
the Gaa -/- mouse model of PD led to a robust reduction in glycogen accumulation 
in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In addition, combining Gys1 ASO with ERT further 
reduced glycogen content in muscle, eliminated autophagic buildup and lysosomal 
dysfunction, and improved motor function in Gaa -/- mice. Our results provide a 
strong foundation for further validation of the use of Gys1 ASO, alone or in 
combination with ERT, as a therapy for PD. We propose that early administration 
of Gys1 ASO in combination with ERT may be the key to preventative treatment 
options in PD.

Quantitative evaluation of tissue images is crucial for computational pathology 
(CPath) tasks, requiring the objective characterization of histopathological 
entities from whole-slide images (WSIs). The high resolution of WSIs and the 
variability of morphological features present significant challenges, 
complicating the large-scale annotation of data for high-performance 
applications. To address this challenge, current efforts have proposed the use 
of pretrained image encoders through transfer learning from natural image 
datasets or self-supervised learning on publicly available histopathology 
datasets, but have not been extensively developed and evaluated across diverse 
tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI, a general-purpose self-supervised model 
for pathology, pretrained using more than 100âmillion images from over 100,000 
diagnostic H&E-stained WSIs (>77âTB of data) across 20 major tissue types. The 
model was evaluated on 34 representative CPath tasks of varying diagnostic 
difficulty. In addition to outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, we 
demonstrate new modeling capabilities in CPath such as resolution-agnostic 
tissue classification, slide classification using few-shot class prototypes, and 
disease subtyping generalization in classifying up to 108 cancer types in the 
OncoTree classification system. UNI advances unsupervised representation 
learning at scale in CPath in terms of both pretraining data and downstream 
evaluation, enabling data-efficient artificial intelligence models that can 
generalize and transfer to a wide range of diagnostically challenging tasks and 
clinical workflows in anatomic pathology.

The accelerated adoption of digital pathology and advances in deep learning have 
enabled the development of robust models for various pathology tasks across a 
diverse array of diseases and patient cohorts. However, model training is often 
difficult due to label scarcity in the medical domain, and a model's usage is 
limited by the specific task and disease for which it is trained. Additionally, 
most models in histopathology leverage only image data, a stark contrast to how 
humans teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities. We introduce 
CONtrastive learning from Captions for Histopathology (CONCH), a visual-language 
foundation model developed using diverse sources of histopathology images, 
biomedical text and, notably, over 1.17 million image-caption pairs through 
task-agnostic pretraining. Evaluated on a suite of 14 diverse benchmarks, CONCH 
can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving histopathology 
images and/or text, achieving state-of-the-art performance on histology image 
classification, segmentation, captioning, and text-to-image and image-to-text 
retrieval. CONCH represents a substantial leap over concurrent visual-language 
pretrained systems for histopathology, with the potential to directly facilitate 
a wide array of machine learning-based workflows requiring minimal or no further 
supervised fine-tuning.

Understanding the loads that occur across musculoskeletal joints is critical to 
advancing our understanding of joint function and pathology, implant design and 
testing, as well as model verification. Substantial work in these areas has 
occurred in the hip and knee but has not yet been undertaken in smaller joints, 
such as those in the wrist. The thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint is a uniquely 
human articulation that is also a common site of osteoarthritis with unknown 
etiology. We present two potential designs for an instrumented trapezium implant 
and compare approaches to load calibration. Two instrumented trapezia designs 
were prototyped using strain gauge technology: Tube and Diaphragm. The Tube 
design is a well-established structure for sensing loads while the Diaphragm is 
novel. Each design was affixed to a 6-DOF load cell that was used as the 
reference. Loads were applied manually, and two calibration methods, supervised 
neural network (DEEP) and matrix algebra (MAT), were implemented. Bland-Altman 
95% confidence interval for the limits of agreement (95% CI LOA) was used to 
assess accuracy. Overall, the DEEP calibration decreased 95% CI LOA compared 
with the MAT approach for both designs. The Diaphragm design outperformed the 
Tube design in measuring the primary load vector (joint compression). 
Importantly, the Diaphragm design permits the hermetic encapsulation of all 
electronics, which is not possible with the Tube design, given the small size of 
the trapezium. Substantial work remains before this device can be approved for 
implantation, but this work lays the foundation for further device development 
that will be required.

BACKGROUND: Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated its great potential on 
medical data analysis. Large datasets collected from diverse sources and 
settings are essential for ML models in healthcare to achieve better accuracy 
and generalizability. Sharing data across different healthcare institutions or 
jurisdictions is challenging because of complex and varying privacy and 
regulatory requirements. Hence, it is hard but crucial to allow multiple parties 
to collaboratively train an ML model leveraging the private datasets available 
at each party without the need for direct sharing of those datasets or 
compromising the privacy of the datasets through collaboration.
METHODS: In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing Decentralized, 
Collaborative, and Privacy-preserving ML for Multi-Hospital Data (DeCaPH). This 
framework offers the following key benefits: (1) it allows different parties to 
collaboratively train an ML model without transferring their private datasets 
(i.e., no data centralization); (2) it safeguards patients' privacy by limiting 
the potential privacy leakage arising from any contents shared across the 
parties during the training process; and (3) it facilitates the ML model 
training without relying on a centralized party/server.
FINDINGS: We demonstrate the generalizability and power of DeCaPH on three 
distinct tasks using real-world distributed medical datasets: patient mortality 
prediction using electronic health records, cell-type classification using 
single-cell human genomes, and pathology identification using chest radiology 
images. The ML models trained with DeCaPH framework have less than 3.2% drop in 
model performance comparing to those trained by the non-privacy-preserving 
collaborative framework. Meanwhile, the average vulnerability to privacy attacks 
of the models trained with DeCaPH decreased by up to 16%. In addition, models 
trained with our DeCaPH framework achieve better performance than those models 
trained solely with the private datasets from individual parties without 
collaboration and those trained with the previous privacy-preserving 
collaborative training framework under the same privacy guarantee by up to 70% 
and 18.2% respectively.
INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that the ML models trained with DeCaPH framework 
have an improved utility-privacy trade-off, showing DeCaPH enables the models to 
have good performance while preserving the privacy of the training data points. 
In addition, the ML models trained with DeCaPH framework in general outperform 
those trained solely with the private datasets from individual parties, showing 
that DeCaPH enhances the model generalizability.

Identifying the invasive cancer area is a crucial step in the automated 
diagnosis of digital pathology slices of the breast. When examining the 
pathological sections of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, several 
evaluations are required specifically for the invasive cancer area. However, 
currently there is little work that can effectively distinguish the invasive 
cancer area from the ductal carcinoma in situ in whole slide images. To address 
this issue, we propose a novel architecture named ResMTUnet that combines the 
strengths of vision transformer and CNN, and uses multi-task learning to achieve 
accurate invasive carcinoma recognition and segmentation in breast cancer. 
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-scale input model based on ResMTUnet with 
conditional random field, named MS-ResMTUNet, to perform segmentation on WSIs. 
Our systematic experimentation has shown that the proposed network outperforms 
other competitive methods and effectively segments invasive carcinoma regions in 
WSIs. This lays a solid foundation for subsequent analysis of breast 
pathological slides in the future. The code is available at:

INTRODUCTION: Developing effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
remains a challenge. This can be partially attributed to the fact that the mouse 
models used in preclinical research largely replicate familial form of AD, while 
majority of human cases are sporadic; both forms differ widely in the onset and 
origin of pathology, therefore requiring specific/targeted treatments.
METHODS: In this study, we aimed to model sporadic AD in mice by combining two 
of the many risk factors that are strongly implicated in AD: ApoE4, a major 
genetic risk factor, together with an inflammatory stimuli. Accordingly, we 
subjected ApoE4 knock in (KI) mice, expressing humanized ApoE4, to low doses of 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections (i.p, weekly, for 4 months).
RESULTS: We assessed these animals for behavioral impairments at 6 months of age 
using Open Field, Y-maze, and Barnes Maze Test. LPS induced hypoactivity was 
observed in the Open Field and Y-maze test, whereas spatial learning and memory 
was intact. We then quantified differences in dendritic spine density, which is 
a strong correlate of AD. ApoE4KI mice showed a significant reduction in the 
number of spines after treatment with LPS, whereas there were no obvious 
differences in the total number of microglia and astrocytes.
DISCUSSION: To conclude, in the current study the APoEe4 risk gene increases the 
vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to inflammation induced spine loss, laying 
a foundation for an early sporadic AD mouse model.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to 
have a substantial impact in the health care space. While a plethora of 
web-based resources exist to teach programming skills and ML model development, 
there are few introductory curricula specifically tailored to medical students 
without a background in data science or programming. Programs that do exist are 
often restricted to a specific specialty.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a 1-month elective for fourth-year medical 
students, composed of high-quality existing web-based resources and a 
project-based structure, would empower students to learn about the impact of AI 
and ML in their chosen specialty and begin contributing to innovation in their 
field of interest. This study aims to evaluate the success of this elective in 
improving self-reported confidence scores in AI and ML. The authors also share 
our curriculum with other educators who may be interested in its adoption.
METHODS: This elective was offered in 2 tracks: technical (for students who were 
already competent programmers) and nontechnical (with no technical 
prerequisites, focusing on building a conceptual understanding of AI and ML). 
Students established a conceptual foundation of knowledge using curated 
web-based resources and relevant research papers, and were then tasked with 
completing 3 projects in their chosen specialty: a data set analysis, a 
literature review, and an AI project proposal. The project-based nature of the 
elective was designed to be self-guided and flexible to each student's interest 
area and career goals. Students' success was measured by self-reported 
confidence in AI and ML skills in pre and postsurveys. Qualitative feedback on 
students' experiences was also collected.
RESULTS: This web-based, self-directed elective was offered on a pass-or-fail 
basis each month to fourth-year students at Emory University School of Medicine 
beginning in May 2021. As of June 2022, a total of 19 students had successfully 
completed the elective, representing a wide range of chosen specialties: 
diagnostic radiology (n=3), general surgery (n=1), internal medicine (n=5), 
neurology (n=2), obstetrics and gynecology (n=1), ophthalmology (n=1), 
orthopedic surgery (n=1), otolaryngology (n=2), pathology (n=2), and pediatrics 
(n=1). Students' self-reported confidence scores for AI and ML rose by 66% after 
this 1-month elective. In qualitative surveys, students overwhelmingly reported 
enthusiasm and satisfaction with the course and commented that the 
self-direction and flexibility and the project-based design of the course were 
essential.
CONCLUSIONS: Course participants were successful in diving deep into 
applications of AI in their widely-ranging specialties, produced substantial 
project deliverables, and generally reported satisfaction with their elective 
experience. The authors are hopeful that a brief, 1-month investment in AI and 
ML education during medical school will empower this next generation of 
physicians to pave the way for AI and ML innovation in health care.

In Huntington disease (HD) the prodromal phase has been increasingly 
investigated and is currently in focus for early interventional treatments. 
Also, the influence of sex on disease progression and severity in patients is 
under discussion, as a sex-specific impact has been reported in transgenic 
rodent models for HD. To this end, we have been studying these aspects in 
Sprague Dawley rats transgenic for HD. Here, we took up on the congenic F344tgHD 
rat model, expressing a fragmented Htt construct with 51 CAG repeats on an 
inbred F344 rat background and characterized potential sexual dimorphism and 
gene-dosage effects in rats during the pre-symptomatic phase (1-8 months of 
age). Our study comprises a longitudinal phenotyping of motor function, emotion 
and sensorimotor gating, as well as screening of metabolic parameters with 
classical and automated assays in combination with investigation of molecular HD 
hallmarks (striatal cell number and volume estimation, appearance of HTT 
aggregates). Differences between sexes became apparent during middle age, 
particularly in the motor and sensorimotor domains. Female individuals were 
generally more active, demonstrated different gait characteristics than males 
and less anxiolytic-like behavior. Alterations in both the time course and 
affected behavioral domains varied between male and female F344tgHD rats. First 
subtle behavioral anomalies were detected in transgenic F344tgHD rats prior to 
striatal MSN cell loss, revealing a prodromal-like phase in this model. Our 
findings demonstrate that the congenic F344tgHD rat model shows high 
face-validity, closely resembling the human disease's temporal progression, 
while having a relatively low number of CAG repeats, a slowly progressing 
pathology with a prodromal-like phase and a comparatively subtle phenotype. By 
differentiating the sexes regarding HD-related changes and characterizing the 
prodromal-like phase in this model, these findings provide a foundation for 
future treatment studies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the United States. 
Tumor Budding (TB) detection and quantification are crucial yet labor-intensive 
steps in determining the CRC stage through the analysis of histopathology 
images. To help with this process, we adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) on 
the CRC histopathology images to segment TBs using SAM-Adapter. In this 
approach, we automatically take task-specific prompts from CRC images and train 
the SAM model in a parameter-efficient way. We compare the predictions of our 
model with the predictions from a trained-from-scratch model using the 
annotations from a pathologist. As a result, our model achieves an intersection 
over union (IoU) of 0.65 and an instance-level Dice score of 0.75, which are 
promising in matching the pathologist's TB annotation. We believe our study 
offers a novel solution to identify TBs on H&E-stained histopathology images. 
Our study also demonstrates the value of adapting the foundation model for 
pathology image segmentation tasks.

OBJECTIVE: Reflex testing protocols allow clinical laboratories to perform 
second line diagnostic tests on existing specimens based on the results of 
initially ordered tests. Reflex testing can support optimal clinical laboratory 
test ordering and diagnosis. In current clinical practice, reflex testing 
typically relies on simple "if-then" rules; however, this limits the 
opportunities for reflex testing since most test ordering decisions involve more 
complexity than traditional rule-based approaches would allow. Here, using the 
analyte ferritin as an example, we propose an alternative machine learning-based 
approach to "smart" reflex testing.
METHODS: Using deidentified patient data, we developed a machine learning model 
to predict whether a patient getting CBC testing will also have ferritin testing 
ordered. We evaluate applications of this model to reflex testing by assessing 
its performance in comparison to possible rule-based approaches.
RESULTS: Our underlying machine learning models performed moderately well in 
predicting ferritin test ordering (AUC=0.731 in reference to actual ordering) 
and demonstrated promising potential to underlie key clinical applications. In 
contrast, none of the many traditionally framed, rule-based, hypothetical reflex 
protocols we evaluated offered sufficient agreement with actual ordering to be 
clinically feasible. Using chart review, we further demonstrated that the 
strategic deployment of our model could avoid important ferritin test ordering 
errors.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning may provide a foundation for new types of reflex 
testing with enhanced benefits for clinical diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major 
challenge in the management of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT). Here, we demonstrated the use of circulating cell-free 
DNA (cfDNA) for detection of tissue turnover and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in 
specific organs.
METHODS: We established a cocktail of tissue-specific DNA methylation markers 
and used it to determine the concentration of cfDNA molecules derived from the 
liver, skin, lungs, colon, and specific immune cells in 101 patients undergoing 
HCT.
RESULTS: Patients with active cGVHD showed elevated concentrations of cfDNA, as 
well as tissue-specific methylation markers that agreed with clinical scores. 
Strikingly, transplanted patients with no clinical symptoms had abnormally high 
levels of tissue-specific markers, suggesting hidden tissue turnover even in the 
absence of evident clinical pathology. An integrative model taking into account 
total cfDNA concentration, monocyte/macrophage cfDNA levels and alanine 
transaminase was able to correctly identify GVHD with a specificity of 86% and 
precision of 89% (AUC of 0.8).
CONCLUSION: cfDNA markers can be used for the detection of cGVHD, opening a 
window into underlying tissue dynamics in patients that receive allogeneic stem 
cell transplants.

BACKGROUND: The occult lymph node metastasis (LNM) of laryngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (LSCC) affects the treatment and prognosis of patients. This study 
aimed to comprehensively compare the performance of the three-dimensional and 
two-dimensional deep learning models, radiomics model, and the fusion models for 
predicting occult LNM in LSCC.
METHODS: In this retrospective diagnostic study, a total of 553 patients with 
clinical N0 stage LSCC, who underwent surgical treatment without distant 
metastasis and multiple primary cancers, were consecutively enrolled from four 
Chinese medical centres between January 01, 2016 and December 30, 2020. The 
participant data were manually retrieved from medical records, imaging 
databases, and pathology reports. The study cohort was divided into a training 
set (nÂ =Â 300), an internal test set (nÂ =Â 89), and two external test sets 
(nÂ =Â 120 and 44, respectively). The three-dimensional deep learning (3D DL), 
two-dimensional deep learning (2D DL), and radiomics model were developed using 
CT images of the primary tumor. The clinical model was constructed based on 
clinical and radiological features. Two fusion strategies were utilized to 
develop the fusion model: the feature-based DLRad_FB model and the 
decision-based DLRad_DB model. The discriminative ability and correlation of 3D 
DL, 2D DL and radiomics features were analysed comprehensively. The performances 
of the predictive models were evaluated based on the pathological diagnosis.
FINDINGS: The 3D DL features had superior discriminative ability and lower 
internal redundancy compared to 2D DL and radiomics features. The DLRad_DB model 
achieved the highest AUC (0.89-0.90) among all the study sets, significantly 
outperforming the clinical model (AUCÂ =Â 0.73-0.78, PÂ =Â 0.0001-0.042, Delong 
test). Compared to the DLRad_DB model, the AUC values for the DLRad_FB, 3D DL, 
2D DL, and radiomics models were 0.82-0.84 (PÂ =Â 0.025-0.46), 0.86-0.89 
(PÂ =Â 0.75-0.97), 0.83-0.86 (PÂ =Â 0.029-0.66), and 0.79-0.82 (PÂ =Â 0.0072-0.10), 
respectively in the study sets. Additionally, the DLRad_DB model exhibited the 
best sensitivity (82-88%) and specificity (79-85%) in the test sets.
INTERPRETATION: The decision-based fusion model DLRad_DB, which combines 3D DL, 
2D DL, radiomics, and clinical data, can be utilized to predict occult LNM in 
LSCC. This has the potential to minimize unnecessary lymph node dissection and 
prophylactic radiotherapy in patients with cN0 disease.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning is a promising way to improve health care. 
Image-processing medical disciplines, such as pathology, are expected to be 
transformed by deep learning. The first clinically applicable deep-learning 
diagnostic support tools are already available in cancer pathology, and their 
number is increasing. However, data on the environmental sustainability of these 
tools are scarce. We aimed to conduct an environmental-sustainability analysis 
of a theoretical implementation of deep learning in patient-care pathology.
METHODS: For this modelling study, we first assembled and calculated relevant 
data and parameters of a digital-pathology workflow. Data were breast and 
prostate specimens from the university clinic at the Institute of Pathology of 
the Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule Aachen (Aachen, Germany), for 
which commercially available deep learning was already available. Only specimens 
collected between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2019 were used, to omit potential biases due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our final selection was based on 2 representative 
weeks outside holidays, covering different types of specimens. To calculate 
carbon dioxide (CO2) or CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions of deep learning in 
pathology, we gathered relevant data for exact numbers and sizes of whole-slide 
images (WSIs), which were generated by scanning histopathology samples of 
prostate and breast specimens. We also evaluated different data input scenarios 
(including all slide tiles, only tiles containing tissue, or only tiles 
containing regions of interest). To convert estimated energy consumption from 
kWh to CO2 eq, we used the internet protocol address of the computational server 
and the Electricity Maps database to obtain information on the sources of the 
local electricity grid (ie, renewable vs non-renewable), and estimated the 
number of trees and proportion of the local and world's forests needed to 
sequester the CO2 eq emissions. We calculated the computational requirements and 
CO2 eq emissions of 30 deep-learning models that varied in task and size. The 
first scenario represented the use of one commercially available deep-learning 
model for one task in one case (1-task), the second scenario considered two 
deep-learning models for two tasks per case (2-task), the third scenario 
represented a future, potentially automated workflow that could handle 7 tasks 
per case (7-task), and the fourth scenario represented the use of a single 
potential, large, computer-vision model that could conduct multiple tasks 
(multitask). We also compared the performance (ie, accuracy) and CO2 eq 
emissions of different deep-learning models for the classification of renal cell 
carcinoma on WSIs, also from Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule 
Aachen. We also tested other approaches to reducing CO2 eq emissions, including 
model pruning and an alternative method for histopathology analysis (pathomics).
FINDINGS: The pathology database contained 35â552 specimens (237â179 slides), 
6420 of which were prostate specimens (10â115 slides) and 11â801 of which were 
breast specimens (19â763 slides). We selected and subsequently digitised 140 
slides from eight breast-cancer cases and 223 slides from five prostate-cancer 
cases. Applying large deep-learning models on all WSI tiles of prostate and 
breast pathology cases would result in yearly CO2 eq emissions of 7Â·65 metric 
tons (t; 95% CI 7Â·62-7Â·68) with the use of a single deep-learning model per 
case; yearly CO2 eq emissions were up to 100Â·56 t (100Â·21-100Â·99) with the use 
of seven deep-learning models per case. CO2 eq emissions for different 
deep-learning model scenarios, data inputs, and deep-learning model sizes for 
all slides varied from 3Â·61 t (3Â·59-3Â·63) to 2795Â·30 t (1177Â·51-6482Â·13. For the 
estimated number of overall pathology cases worldwide, the yearly CO2 eq 
emissions varied, reaching up to 16 megatons (Mt) of CO2 eq, requiring up to 86 
590 km2 (0Â·22%) of world forest to sequester the CO2 eq emissions. Use of the 
7-task scenario and small deep-learning models on slides containing tissue only 
could substantially reduce CO2 eq emissions worldwide by up to 141 times (0Â·1 
Mt, 95% CI 0Â·1-0Â·1). Considering the local environment in Aachen, Germany, the 
maximum CO2 eq emission from the use of deep learning in digital pathology only 
would require 32Â·8% (95% CI 13Â·8-76Â·6) of the local forest to sequester the CO2 
eq emissions. A single pathomics run on a tissue could provide information that 
was comparable to or even better than the output of multitask deep-learning 
models, but with 147 times reduced CO2 eq emissions.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that widespread use of deep learning in 
pathology might have considerable global-warming potential. The medical 
community, policy decision makers, and the public should be aware of this 
potential and encourage the use of CO2 eq emissions reduction strategies where 
possible.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy 
globally and ranks third in terms of both mortality and incidence rates. 
Surgical resection holds potential as a curative approach for HCC. However, the 
residual disease contributes to a high 5-year recurrence rate of 70%. Due to 
their excellent specificity and optical properties, fluorescence-targeted probes 
are deemed effective auxiliary tools for addressing residual lesions, enabling 
precise surgical diagnosis and treatment. Research indicates histone deacetylase 
6 (HDAC6) overexpression in HCC cells, making it a potential imaging biomarker. 
This study designed a targeted small-molecule fluorescent probe, 
SeCF3-IRDye800cw (SeCF3-IRD800), operating within the Second near-infrared 
window (NIR-II, 1000-1700Â nm). The study confirms the biocompatibility of 
SeCF3-IRD800 and proceeds to demonstrate its applications in imaging inÂ vivo, 
fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) for liver cancer, liver fibrosis imaging, and 
clinical samples incubation, thereby preliminarily validating its utility in 
liver cancer.
METHODS: SeCF3-IRD800 was synthesized by combining the near-infrared fluorescent 
dye IRDye800cw-NHS with an improved HDAC6 inhibitor. Initially, a HepG2-Luc 
subcutaneous tumor model (nÂ =Â 12) was constructed to investigate the metabolic 
differences between SeCF3-IRD800 and ICG inÂ vivo. Subsequently, HepG2-Luc 
(nÂ =Â 12) and HCCLM3-Luc (nÂ =Â 6) subcutaneous xenograft mouse models were used to 
assess inÂ vivo targeting by SeCF3-IRD800. The HepG2-Luc orthotopic liver cancer 
model (nÂ =Â 6) was employed to showcase the application of SeCF3-IRD800 in FGS. 
Liver fibrosis (nÂ =Â 6) and HepG2-Luc orthotopic (nÂ =Â 6) model imaging results 
were used to evaluate the impact of different pathological backgrounds on 
SeCF3-IRD800 imaging. Three groups of fresh HCC and normal liver samples from 
patients with liver cancer were utilized for SeCF3-IRD800 incubation exÂ vivo, 
while preclinical experiments illustrated its potential for clinical 
application.
FINDINGS: The HDAC6 inhibitor 6 (SeCF3) modified with trifluoromethyl was 
labeled with IRDy800CW-NHS to synthesize the small-molecule targeted probe 
SeCF3-IRD800, with NIR-II fluorescence signals. SeCF3-IRD800 was rapidly 
metabolized by the kidneys and exhibited excellent biocompatibility. InÂ vivo 
validation demonstrated that SeCF3-IRD800 achieved optimal imaging within 8Â h, 
displaying high tumor fluorescence intensity (7658.41Â Â±Â 933.34) and high 
tumor-to-background ratio (5.20Â Â±Â 1.04). Imaging experiments with various 
expression levels revealed its capacity for HDAC6-specific targeting across 
multiple HCC tumor models, suitable for NIR-II intraoperative imaging. 
Fluorescence-guided surgery experiments were found feasible and capable of 
detecting sub-visible 2Â mm tumor lesions under white light, aiding surgical 
decision-making. Further imaging of liver fibrosis mice showed that 
SeCF3-IRD800's imaging efficacy remained unaffected by liver pathological 
conditions. Correlations were observed between HDAC6 expression levels and 
corresponding fluorescence intensity (R2Â =Â 0.8124) among normal liver, liver 
fibrosis, and HCC tissues. SeCF3-IRD800 identified HDAC6-positive samples from 
patients with HCC, holding advantages for perspective intraoperative 
identification in liver cancer. Thus, the rapidly metabolized HDAC6-targeted 
small-molecule NIR-II fluorescence probe SeCF3-IRD800 holds significant clinical 
translational value.
INTERPRETATION: The successful application of NIR-II fluorescence-guided surgery 
in liver cancer indicates that SeCF3-IRD800 has great potential to improve the 
clinical diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, and could be used as an 
auxiliary tool for surgical treatment of liver cancer without being affected by 
liver pathology.

PURPOSE: Foundation models are a novel type of artificial intelligence 
algorithms, in which models are pretrained at scale on unannotated data and 
fine-tuned for a myriad of downstream tasks, such as generating text. This study 
assessed the accuracy of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in the 
ophthalmology question-answering space.
DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology.
PARTICIPANTS: ChatGPT is a publicly available LLM.
METHODS: We tested 2 versions of ChatGPT (January 9 "legacy" and ChatGPT Plus) 
on 2 popular multiple choice question banks commonly used to prepare for the 
high-stakes Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) examination. We 
generated two 260-question simulated exams from the Basic and Clinical Science 
Course (BCSC) Self-Assessment Program and the OphthoQuestions online question 
bank. We carried out logistic regression to determine the effect of the 
examination section, cognitive level, and difficulty index on answer accuracy. 
We also performed a post hoc analysis using Tukey's test to decide if there were 
meaningful differences between the tested subspecialties.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We reported the accuracy of ChatGPT for each examination 
section in percentage correct by comparing ChatGPT's outputs with the answer key 
provided by the question banks. We presented logistic regression results with a 
likelihood ratio (LR) chi-square. We considered differences between examination 
sections statistically significant at a P value of < 0.05.
RESULTS: The legacy model achieved 55.8% accuracy on the BCSC set and 42.7% on 
the OphthoQuestions set. With ChatGPT Plus, accuracy increased to 59.4% Â± 0.6% 
and 49.2% Â± 1.0%, respectively. Accuracy improved with easier questions when 
controlling for the examination section and cognitive level. Logistic regression 
analysis of the legacy model showed that the examination section (LR, 27.57; PÂ = 
0.006) followed by question difficulty (LR, 24.05; P < 0.001) were most 
predictive of ChatGPT's answer accuracy. Although the legacy model performed 
best in general medicine and worst in neuro-ophthalmology (P < 0.001) and ocular 
pathology (PÂ = 0.029), similar post hoc findings were not seen with ChatGPT 
Plus, suggesting more consistent results across examination sections.
CONCLUSION: ChatGPT has encouraging performance on a simulated OKAP examination. 
Specializing LLMs through domain-specific pretraining may be necessary to 
improve their performance in ophthalmic subspecialties.

Accurate pathological classification and grading of gliomas is crucial in 
clinical diagnosis and treatment. The application of deep learning techniques 
holds promise for automated histological pathology diagnosis. In this study, we 
collected 733 whole slide images from four medical centers, of which 456 were 
used for model training, 150 for internal validation, and 127 for multi-center 
testing. The study includes 5 types of common gliomas. A subtask-guided 
multi-instance learning image-to-label training pipeline was employed. The 
pipeline leveraged "patch prompting" for the model to converge with reasonable 
computational cost. Experiments showed that an overall accuracy of 0.79 in the 
internal validation dataset. The performance on the multi-center testing dataset 
showed an overall accuracy to 0.73. The findings suggest a minor yet acceptable 
performance decrease in multi-center data, demonstrating the model's strong 
generalizability and establishing a robust foundation for future clinical 
applications.

To search for subunit vaccine candidates, immunogenic chlamydial antigens 
identified in humans were evaluated for protection against both infection and 
pathology in a mouse genital tract infection model under three different 
immunization regimens. The intramuscular immunization regimen was first used to 
evaluate 106 chlamydial antigens, which revealed that two antigens significantly 
reduced while 11 increased genital chlamydial burden. The two infection-reducing 
antigens failed to prevent pathology and 23 additional antigens even exacerbated 
pathology. Thus, intranasal mucosal immunization was tested next since 
intranasal inoculation with live Chlamydia muridarum prevented both genital 
infection and pathology. Two of the 29 chlamydial antigens evaluated were found 
to prevent genital infection but not pathology and three exacerbate pathology. 
To further improve protection efficacy, a combinational regimen (intranasal 
priming + intramuscular boosting + a third intraperitoneal/subcutaneous boost) 
was tested. This regimen identified four infection-reducing antigens, but only 
one of them prevented pathology. Unfortunately, this protective antigen was not 
advanced further due to its amino acid sequence homology with several human 
molecules. Two pathology-exacerbating antigens were also found. Nevertheless, 
intranasal mucosal priming with viable C. muridarum in control groups 
consistently prevented both genital infection and pathology regardless of the 
subsequent boosters. Thus, screening 140 different chlamydial antigens with 21 
repeated multiple times in 17 experiments failed to identify a subunit vaccine 
candidate but demonstrated the superiority of viable chlamydial organisms in 
inducing immunity against both genital infection and pathology, laying the 
foundation for developing a live-attenuated Chlamydia vaccine.

Aspergillus versicolor is ubiquitous in the environment and is particularly 
abundant in damp indoor spaces. Exposure to Aspergillus species, as well as 
other environmental fungi, has been linked to respiratory health outcomes, 
including asthma, allergy, and even local or disseminated infection. However, 
the pulmonary immunological mechanisms associated with repeated exposure to A. 
versicolor have remained relatively uncharacterized. Here, A. versicolor was 
cultured and desiccated on rice then placed in an acoustical generator system to 
achieve aerosolization. Mice were challenged with titrated doses of aerosolized 
conidia to examine deposition, lymphoproliferative properties, and 
immunotoxicological response to repeated inhalation exposures. The necessary 
dose to induce lymphoproliferation was identified, but not infection-like 
pathology. Further, it was determined that the dose was able to initiate 
localized immune responses. The data presented in this study demonstrate an 
optimized and reproducible method for delivering A. versicolor conidia to 
rodents via nose-only inhalation. Additionally, the feasibility of a long-term 
repeated exposure study was established. This experimental protocol can be used 
in future studies to investigate the physiological effects of repeated pulmonary 
exposure to fungal conidia utilizing a practical and relevant mode of delivery. 
In total, these data constitute an important foundation for subsequent research 
in the field.

Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of 
analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workflow. Whole-slide 
imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer 
monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a 
promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, 
convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human 
performance in many image-processing and computer vision tasks. The performance 
of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated 
training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development 
in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and 
lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new 
datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or 
tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and 
generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable 
data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a 
modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide 
in-context learning, can self-correct mistakes, and promptly adjust to user 
feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in 
computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and 
limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create 
a pathology-specific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and 
present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe 
different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of 
pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine 
laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology 
reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that 
foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology 
laboratory workflow, education, and training.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that progresses with age. 
Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) aggregation has been suggested to be a key pathogenic process in 
Alzheimer's disease. Ginseng polysaccharides (GP), the main biologically active 
components isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (ginseng), may act as 
neuroprotective agents with potential benefits for AD patients. However, GP 
effects on AÎ² pathology and AD symptoms are still unclear. Here, a 4.7-kDa GP 
termed GP4 was purified and subjected to basic physicochemical characterization. 
The biological effects of GP4 to prevent AÎ² aggregation were then assessed with 
cross-species AD models, including Aftin-5-treated SH-SY5Y cells and cerebral 
organoids, and transgenic C. elegans overexpressing the full-length human AÎ²42 
peptide. These analyses ultimately demonstrated that GP4 was capable of 
inhibiting AÎ² accumulation both in vivo and vitro, and with early intervention 
of GP4 being sufficient to alleviate AÎ²42-associated aging phenotypes and memory 
loss in C. elegans model of AD. Furthermore, neuroinflammation was significantly 
down-regulated in human cells and cerebral organoids. From a mechanistic 
perspective, the ability of GP4 to inhibit AÎ² aggregation was found to be 
related to its ability to promote neuronal mitophagic activity. This finding 
offers a robust theoretical foundation for the further development of GP4 as a 
candidate drugs with the potential to treat AD.

BACKGROUND: The unfolding protein response is a critical biological process 
implicated in a variety of physiological functions and disease states across 
eukaryotes. Despite its significance, the role and underlying mechanisms of the 
response in the context of ischemic stroke remain elusive. Hence, this study 
endeavors to shed light on the mechanisms and role of the unfolding protein 
response in the context of ischemic stroke.
METHODS: In this study, mRNA expression patterns were extracted from the 
GSE58294 and GSE16561 datasets in the GEO database. The screening and validation 
of protein response-related biomarkers in stroke patients, as well as the 
analysis of the immune effects of the pathway, were carried out. To identify the 
key genes in the unfolded protein response, we constructed diagnostic models 
using both random forest and support vector machine-recursive feature 
elimination methods. The internal validation was performed using a bootstrapping 
approach based on a random sample of 1,000 iterations. Lastly, the target gene 
was validated by RT-PCR using clinical samples. We utilized two algorithms, 
CIBERSORT and MCPcounter, to investigate the relationship between the model 
genes and immune cells. Additionally, we performed uniform clustering of 
ischemic stroke samples based on expression of genes related to the UPR pathway 
and analyzed the relationship between different clusters and clinical traits. 
The weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify the 
core genes in various clusters, followed by enrichment analysis and protein 
profiling for the hub genes from different clusters.
RESULTS: Our differential analysis revealed 44 genes related to the UPR pathway 
to be statistically significant. The integration of both machine learning 
algorithms resulted in the identification of 7 key genes, namely ATF6, EXOSC5, 
EEF2, LSM4, NOLC1, BANF1, and DNAJC3. These genes served as the foundation for a 
diagnostic model, with an area under the curve of 0.972. Following 1000 rounds 
of internal validation via randomized sampling, the model was confirmed to 
exhibit high levels of both specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, the 
expression of these genes was found to be linked with the infiltration of immune 
cells such as neutrophils and CD8 T cells. The cluster analysis of ischemic 
stroke samples revealed three distinct groups, each with differential expression 
of most genes related to the UPR pathway, immune cell infiltration, and 
inflammatory factor secretion. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
showed that all three clusters were associated with the unfolded protein 
response, as evidenced by gene enrichment analysis and the protein landscape of 
each cluster. The results showed that the expression of the target gene in blood 
was consistent with the previous analysis.
CONCLUSION: The study of the relationship between UPR and ischemic stroke can 
help to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease and provide 
new targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, targeting the UPR pathway 
by blocking excessive autophagy or inducing moderate UPR could potentially 
reduce tissue injury and promote cell survival after ischemic stroke. In 
addition, the results of this study suggest that the use of UPR gene expression 
levels as biomarkers could improve the accuracy of early diagnosis and prognosis 
of ischemic stroke, leading to more personalized treatment strategies. Overall, 
this study highlights the importance of the UPR pathway in the pathology of 
ischemic stroke and provides a foundation for future studies in this field.

Breast cancer is categorized by the molecular and histologic presentation of the 
tumor, with the major histologic subtypes being No Special Type (NST) and 
Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC). ILC are characterized by growth in a single 
file discohesive manner with stromal infiltration attributed to their hallmark 
pathognomonic loss of E-cadherin ( CDH1 ). Few ILC cell line models are 
available to researchers. Here we report the successful establishment and 
characterization of a novel ILC cell line, WCRC-25, from a metastatic pleural 
effusion from a postmenopausal Caucasian woman with metastatic ILC. WCRC-25 is 
an ER-negative luminal epithelial ILC cell line with both luminal and Her2-like 
features. It exhibits anchorage independent growth and haptotactic migration 
towards Collagen I. Sequencing revealed a CDH1 Q706* truncating mutation, 
together with mutations in FOXA1, CTCF, BRCA2 and TP53 , which were also seen in 
a series of metastatic lesions from the patient. Copy number analyses revealed 
amplification and deletion of genes frequently altered in ILC while optical 
genome mapping revealed novel structural rearrangements. RNA-seq analysis 
comparing the primary tumor, metastases and the cell line revealed signatures 
for cell cycle progression and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. To assess 
targetability, we treated WCRC-25 with AZD5363 and Alpelisib confirming WCRC-25 
as susceptible to PI3K/AKT signaling inhibition as predicted by our RNA 
sequencing analysis. In conclusion, we report WCRC-25 as a novel ILC cell line 
with promise as a valuable research tool to advance our understanding of ILC and 
its therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Increasing evidence implicates decreased energy metabolism and mitochondrial 
dysfunctions among the earliest pathogenic events of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying bioenergetic dysfunctions in AD 
remain, to date, largely unknown. In this work, we analyzed transcriptomic 
changes occurring in the hippocampus and retina of a Tg2576 AD mouse model and 
wild-type controls, evaluating their functional implications by gene set 
enrichment analysis. The results revealed that oxidative phosphorylation and 
mitochondrial-related pathways are significantly down-regulated in both tissues 
of Tg2576 mice, supporting the role of these processes in the pathogenesis of 
AD. In addition, we also analyzed transcriptomic changes occurring in Tg2576 
mice treated with the 12A12 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes an AD-relevant 
tau-derived neurotoxic peptide in vivo. Our analysis showed that the 
mitochondrial alterations observed in AD mice were significantly reverted by 
treatment with 12A12mAb, supporting bioenergetic pathways as key mediators of 
its in vivo neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic effects. This study provides, 
for the first time, a comprehensive characterization of molecular events 
underlying the disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics in AD pathology, laying the 
foundation for the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Microglial cGAS deletion protects against amyloid-Î² induced Alzheimer's disease 
pathogenesis.

He S, Li X, Mittra N, Bhattacharjee A, Wang H, Zhao S, Liu F, Han X.

Innate immune activation plays a vital role in the development of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Among which, the DNA sensing cyclic 
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)- STING pathway has been implicated in diverse aspects of 
AD progression. In the current study, we showed that the cGAS-STING signaling 
was up-regulated in AD and this elevation was mainly contributed by the 
microglial population other than non-microglial cell types in the brain. By 
establishing an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in 5xFAD 
background, we found that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-Î² 
(AÎ²) pathology significantly limited plaque formation, and protected mice from 
AÎ²-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, we found cGAS was necessary 
for plaque-associated microglial enrichment potentially driven by IRF8, and was 
indispensable for the development of disease-associated microglia (DAM) 
phenotype. Meanwhile, the loss of microglial cGAS reduced the levels of 
dystrophic neurites which led to preserved synaptic integrity and neuronal 
function. Our study provides new insights in understanding the effects of innate 
immune in AD via a cell-type specific manner, and lays the foundation for 
potential targeted intervention of the microglial cGAS-STING pathway toward the 
improvement of AD.

OBJECTIVES: We present the long-term results of a trileaflet (Triflo) versus 
bileaflet (On-X) mechanical valve in both aortic and pulmonary positions in a 
sheep model.
METHODS: The Triflo valve was implanted in 21 female sheep in aortic (nâ=â8) and 
pulmonary position (nâ=â13). The On-X valve was implanted in 7 female sheep in 
aortic (nâ=â1) and pulmonary (nâ=â6) positions. No antithrombotic medication of 
any kind was given postoperatively. In the aortic group, survival cohorts were 3 
and 5âmonths. In the pulmonary group, survival cohorts were 10 and 20âweeks. 
Valve performance was assessed using haematology, echocardiography and acoustic 
measurements combined with post-mortem pathology analysis of the downstream 
organs.
RESULTS: The mean gradients were lower for the Triflo valve in both pulmonary 
[4.30âmmHg (3.70-5.73) vs 6.80âmmHg (4.63-7.96), Pâ=â0.012] and aortic [5.1âmmHg 
(4.2-7.7) vs 10.7âmmHg (8.7-12.9), Pâ=â0.007] positions. Peak gradients were 
lower for the Triflo valve in both pulmonary [8.05âmmHg (6.75-10.23) vs 
13.15âmmHg (9.20-14.76), Pâ=â0.005] and aortic [8.7âmmHg (7.5-12.5) vs 16.5âmmHg 
(14.2-19.6), Pâ=â0.009] positions. In both positions, leaflets and housing 
surface were free from any deposits macro- and microscopically and comparable to 
nonimplanted control valves. Peripheral organs showed no signs of 
thrombo-embolic damage. Biochemical and haematological were comparable to 
preoperative. The closing click sound pressure level of the Triflo was 
significantly lower in both aortic [108.4 sound pressure level (102.0-115.7) vs 
111.7 sound pressure level (105.5-117.0), Pâ<â0.001] and pulmonary [103.6 sound 
pressure level (99.1-108.9) vs 118.5 sound pressure level (116.7-120.2), 
Pâ<â0.001] position.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary in vivo results of the Triflo valve are promising in 
both aortic and pulmonary positions in an ovine model. Excellent haemodynamics, 
stable long-term function, low valve noise and no thrombo-embolic events in the 
absence of antithrombotic medication lay the foundation to a future clinical 
first-in-man trial.

PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²2 has been widely implicated in human 
glaucoma pathology. The purpose of this study was to determine the source of 
TGF-Î²2 in aqueous humor (AH) and its relationship with intraocular pressure 
(IOP) in an inherited large animal model of glaucoma.
METHODS: Sixty-six glaucomatous cats homozygous for LTBP2 mutation, and 42 
normal cats were studied. IOP was measured weekly by rebound tonometry. AH was 
collected by anterior chamber paracentesis from each eye under general 
anesthesia, and serum samples collected from venous blood concurrently. 
Concentrations of total, active and latent TGF-Î²2 in AH and serum samples were 
measured by quantitative sandwich immunoassay. For comparisons between groups, 
unpaired t-test or Mann Whitney test were used, with P < 0.05 considered 
significant. The relationships between TGF-Î²2 concentrations and IOP values were 
examined by Pearson's correlation coefficient and generalized estimating 
equation.
RESULTS: IOP and AH TGF-Î²2 concentrations were significantly higher in 
glaucomatous than in normal cats. AH TGF-Î²2 showed a significant, robust 
positive correlation with IOP in glaucomatous cats (r = 0.83, R2 = 0.70, P < 
0.0001). Serum TGF-Î²2 did not correlate with AH TGF-Î²2 and was not significantly 
different between groups. TGF-Î²2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly 
increased in local ocular tissues in glaucomatous cats.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced, local ocular production of TGF-Î²2 with a robust positive 
association with IOP was identified in this spontaneous feline glaucoma model, 
providing a foundation for preclinical testing of novel therapeutics to limit 
disease-associated AH TGF-Î²2 elevation and signaling in glaucoma.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to construct an animal model of Graves' 
ophthalmopathy (GO) by comparing recombinant adenovirus expressing human 
thyrotropin receptor A subunit (Ad-TSHR A) gene immunization and dendritic cell 
(DC) immunization. We evaluated the animal models that are closer to the 
pathology of human GO, and laid the foundation for the study of GO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ad-TSHR A was injected intramuscularly into female BALB/c 
mice to induce the GO animal model. A GO animal model was constructed using TSHR 
combined with IFN-Î³-modified primary DC immunized female BALB/c. The animal 
models constructed by the above two methods were evaluated in terms of ocular 
appearance, serology, pathology, and imaging to assess the modeling rate of the 
animal models, respectively.
RESULTS: Both modeled mice exhibited increased serological indexes of free 
thyroxine (FT4) and TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs) levels and decreased TSH (P 
< 0.01). Thyroid pathology analysis revealed the number of thyroid follicles 
increases, the size varies, and the follicular epithelial cells proliferate to 
varying degrees in a cuboidal or tall columnar pattern, with a small amount of 
lymphocytic infiltration visible. Adipose tissue behind the eyeball was 
accumulated, the muscle outside the eyeball was broken and fibrotic, and 
hyaluronic acid (HA) behind the eyeball was increased. The animal model of GO 
constructed by immunization of TSHR with IFN-Î³-modified DC had a modeling rate 
of 60%, whereas that of Ad-TSHR A gene immunization was 72%.
CONCLUSIONS: Both gene immunization and cellular immunization can be used to 
construct GO models, and the modeling rate of gene immunization is higher than 
that of cellular immunization.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In this study, two innovative methods, cellular 
immunity and gene immunity, were used to establish GO animal models, which 
improved the success rate to a certain extent. To our knowledge, this study 
presents the first cellular immunity modeling idea of TSHR combined with IFN-Î³ 
for the GO animal model, which provides an animal model basis for understanding 
the pathogenesis of GO and developing new treatment methods.

BACKGROUND: Anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies (mAbs) are approved immunotherapy 
agents to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Only a 
minority of patients responds to these treatments and biomarkers predicting 
response are currently lacking.
METHODS: Immunoscore-Immune-Checkpoint (Immunoscore-IC), an inÂ vitro diagnostic 
test, was used on 471 routine single FFPE-slides, and the 
duplex-immunohistochemistry CD8 and PD-L1 staining was quantified using 
digital-pathology. Analytical validation was performed on two independent 
cohorts of 206 NSCLC patients. Quantitative parameters related to cell location, 
number, proximity and clustering were analysed. The Immunoscore-IC was applied 
on a first cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients (nÂ =Â 133), treated with anti-PD1 
or anti-PD-L1 mAbs. Another independent cohort (nÂ =Â 132) served as validation.
FINDINGS: Anti-PDL1 clone (HDX3) has similar characteristics as anti-PD-L1 
clones (22C3, SP263). Densities of PD-L1+ cells, CD8+ cells and distances 
between CD8+ and PD-L1+ cells were quantified and the Immunoscore-IC 
classification was computed. Using univariate Cox model, 5 histological 
dichotomised variables (CD8 free of PD-L1+ cells, CD8 clusters, CD8 cells in 
proximity of PD-L1 cells, CD8 density and PD-L1 cells in proximity of CD8 cells) 
were significantly associated with Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (all 
PÂ <Â 0.0001). Immunoscore-IC classification improved the discriminating power of 
prognostic model, which included clinical variables and pathologist PD-L1 
assessment. In two categories, the Immunoscore-IC risk-score was significantly 
associated with patients' PFS (HRÂ =Â 0.39, 95% CI (0.26-0.59), PÂ <Â 0.0001) and 
Overall Survival (OS) (HRÂ =Â 0.42, 95% CI (0.27-0.65), PÂ <Â 0.0001) in the 
training-set. Further increased hazard ratios (HR) were found when stratifying 
patients into three-category Immunoscore-IC (IS-IC). All patients with Low-IS-IC 
progressed in less than 18 months, whereas PFS at 36 months were 34% and 33% of 
High-IS-IC patients in the training and validation sets, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Immunoscore-IC is a powerful tool to predict the efficacy of 
immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with NSCLC.

Introducing the Neuroplastic Narrative: a non-pathologizing biological 
foundation for trauma-informed and adverse childhood experience aware

Most people accessing mental health services have adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs) and/or histories of complex trauma. In recognition of this, there are 
calls to move away from medical model approaches and move toward trauma-informed 
approaches which privilege the impact of life experience over underlying 
pathology in the etiology of emotional and psychological suffering. 
Trauma-informed approaches lack a biological narrative linking trauma and 
adversity to later suffering. In its absence, this suffering is diagnosed and 
treated as a mental illness. This study articulates the Neuroplastic Narrative, 
a neuroecological theory that fills this gap, conceptualizing emotional and 
psychological suffering as the cost of surviving and adapting to the impinging 
environments of trauma and adversity. The Neuroplastic Narrative privileges 
lived experience and recognizes that our experiences become embedded in our 
biology through evolved mechanisms that ultimately act to preserve survival in 
the service of reproduction. Neuroplasticity refers to the capacity of neural 
systems to adapt and change. Our many evolved neuroplastic mechanisms including 
epigenetics, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and white matter plasticity 
allow us to learn from, and adapt to, past experiences. This learning and 
adaption in turn allows us to better anticipate and physiologically prepare for 
future experiences that (nature assumes) are likely to occur, based on past 
experiences. However, neuroplastic mechanisms cannot discriminate between 
experiences; they function to embed experience regardless of the quality of that 
experience, generating vicious or virtuous cycles of psychobiological 
anticipation, to help us survive or thrive in futures that resemble our 
privileged or traumatic pasts. The etiology of suffering that arises from this 
process is not a pathology (a healthy brain is a brain that can adapt to 
experience) but is the evolutionary cost of surviving traumatizing environments. 
Misidentifying this suffering as a pathology and responding with diagnosis and 
medication is not trauma-informed and may cause iatrogenic harm, in part through 
perpetuating stigma and exacerbating the shame which attends complex trauma and 
ACEs. As an alternative, this study introduces the Neuroplastic Narrative, which 
is situated within an evolutionary framework. The Neuroplastic Narrative 
complements both Life History and Attachment Theory and provides a 
non-pathologizing, biological foundation for trauma-informed and Adverse 
Childhood Experience aware approaches.

BACKGROUND: Although WD repeats domain 45 (WDR45) mutations have been linked to 
Î²-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), the precise molecular 
and cellular mechanisms behind this disease remain elusive. This study aims to 
shed light on the effects of WDR45-deficiency on neurodegeneration, specifically 
axonal degeneration, within the midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) system. By 
examining pathological and molecular alterations, we hope to better understand 
the disease process.
METHODS: To investigate the effects of WDR45 dysfunction on mouse behaviors and 
DAergic neurons, we developed a mouse model in which WDR45 was conditionally 
knocked out in midbrain DAergic neurons (WDR45cKO). Through a longitudinal 
study, we assessed alterations in mouse behavior using open field, rotarod, 
Y-maze, and 3-chamber social approach tests. To examine the pathological changes 
in DAergic neuron soma and axons, we utilized a combination of 
immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, 
we performed proteomic analyses of the striatum to identify the molecules and 
processes involved in striatal pathology.
RESULTS: Our study of WDR45cKO mice revealed a range of deficits, including 
impaired motor function, emotional instability, and memory loss, coinciding with 
the profound loss of midbrain DAergic neurons. Prior to neuronal loss, we 
observed massive axonal enlargements in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. 
These enlargements were characterized by the accumulation of extensively 
fragmented tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a hallmark of axonal 
degeneration. Additionally, we found that WDR45cKO mice exhibited disrupted 
autophagic flux. Proteomic analysis of the striatum in these mice showed that 
many differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were enriched in amino acid, 
lipid, and tricarboxylic acid metabolisms. Of note, we observed significant 
alterations in the expression of genes encoding DEPs that regulate phospholipids 
catabolic and biosynthetic processes, such as lysophosphatidylcholine 
acyltransferase 1, ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase, and abhydrolase domain 
containing 4, N-acyl phospholipase B. These findings suggest a possible link 
between phospholipid metabolism and striatal axon degeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have uncovered the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the contribution of WDR45-deficiency to axonal degeneration, 
revealing intricate relationships between tubular ER dysfunction, phospholipid 
metabolism, BPAN and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings 
significantly advance our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms 
driving neurodegeneration and may provide a foundation for developing novel, 
mechanistically-based therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Central Nervous System (CNS) 
tumor classification increasingly emphasizes the important role of molecular 
markers in glioma diagnoses. Preoperatively non-invasive "integrated diagnosis" 
will bring great benefits to the treatment and prognosis of these patients with 
special tumor locations that cannot receive craniotomy or needle biopsy. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and liquid biopsy (LB) have great 
potential for non-invasive diagnosis of molecular markers and grading since they 
are both easy to perform. This study aims to build a novel multi-task deep 
learning (DL) radiomic model to achieve preoperative non-invasive "integrated 
diagnosis" of glioma based on the 2021 WHO-CNS classification and explore 
whether the DL model with LB parameters can improve the performance of glioma 
diagnosis.
METHODS: This is a double-center, ambispective, diagnostical observational 
study. One public database named the 2019 Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge 
dataset (BraTS) and two original datasets, including the Second Affiliated 
Hospital of Nanchang University, and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, will 
be used to develop the multi-task DL radiomic model. As one of the LB 
techniques, circulating tumor cell (CTC) parameters will be additionally applied 
in the DL radiomic model for assisting the "integrated diagnosis" of glioma. The 
segmentation model will be evaluated with the Dice index, and the performance of 
the DL model for WHO grading and all molecular subtype will be evaluated with 
the indicators of accuracy, precision, and recall.
DISCUSSION: Simply relying on radiomics features to find the correlation with 
the molecular subtypes of gliomas can no longer meet the need for "precisely 
integrated prediction." CTC features are a promising biomarker that may provide 
new directions in the exploration of "precision integrated prediction" based on 
the radiomics, and this is the first original study that combination of 
radiomics and LB technology for glioma diagnosis. We firmly believe that this 
innovative work will surely lay a good foundation for the "precisely integrated 
prediction" of glioma and point out further directions for future research.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are activated by damage or 
disease. In mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), microglia shift 
from neurotrophic to neurotoxic states with disease progression. It remains 
unclear how human microglia change relative to the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
(TDP-43) aggregation that occurs in 97% of ALS cases. Here we examine spatial 
relationships between microglial activation and TDP-43 pathology in brain tissue 
from people with ALS and from a TDP-43-driven ALS mouse model. Post-mortem human 
brain tissue from the Neurological Foundation Human Brain Bank was obtained from 
10 control and 10 ALS cases in parallel with brain tissue from a bigenic 
NEFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43âNLS (rNLS) mouse model of ALS at disease onset, early 
disease, and late disease stages. The spatiotemporal relationship between 
microglial activation and ALS pathology was determined by investigating 
microglial functional marker expression in brain regions with low and high 
TDP-43 burden at end-stage human disease: hippocampus and motor cortex, 
respectively. Sections were immunohistochemically labelled with a two-round 
multiplexed antibody panel against; microglial functional markers (L-ferritin, 
HLA-DR, CD74, CD68, and Iba1), a neuronal marker, an astrocyte marker, and 
pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). Single-cell levels of microglial 
functional markers were quantified using custom analysis pipelines and mapped to 
anatomical regions and ALS pathology. We identified a significant increase in 
microglial Iba1 and CD68 expression in the human ALS motor cortex, with 
microglial CD68 being significantly correlated with pTDP-43 pathology load. We 
also identified two subpopulations of microglia enriched in the ALS motor cortex 
that were defined by high L-ferritin expression. A similar pattern of microglial 
changes was observed in the rNLS mouse, with an increase first in CD68 and then 
in L-ferritin expression, with both occurring only after pTDP-43 inclusions were 
detectable. Our data strongly suggest that microglia are phagocytic at 
early-stage ALS but transition to a dysfunctional state at end-stage disease, 
and that these functional states are driven by pTDP-43 aggregation. Overall, 
these findings enhance our understanding of microglial phenotypes and function 
in ALS.

Periodically oscillating biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, are 
carefully concerted events that are only beginning to be understood in the 
context of tissue pathology and organismal health, as well as the molecular 
mechanisms underlying these interactions. Recent reports indicate that light can 
independently entrain peripheral circadian clocks, challenging the currently 
prevalent hierarchical model. Despite the recent progress that has been made, a 
comprehensive overview of these periodic processes in skin is lacking in the 
literature. In this review, molecular circadian clock machinery and the factors 
that govern it have been highlighted. Circadian rhythm is closely linked to 
immunological processes and skin homeostasis, and its desynchrony can be linked 
to the perturbation of the skin. The interplay between circadian rhythm and 
annual, seasonal oscillations, as well as the impact of these periodic events on 
the skin, is described. Finally, the changes that occur in the skin over a 
lifespan are presented. This work encourages further research into the 
oscillating biological processes occurring in the skin and lays the foundation 
for future strategies to combat the adverse effects of desynchrony, which would 
likely have implications in other tissues influenced by periodic oscillatory 
processes.

PURPOSE: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a chronic inflammatory disease highly 
associated with intra-articular hypertension, hypoxia and angiogenesis of 
synovial tissue. Our previous studies showed that acupotomy could treat KOA in a 
variety of ways, including reducing cartilage deterioration and enhancing 
biomechanical qualities. However, the mechanism of hypoxia and angiogenesis 
induced by acupotomy in KOA synovium remains unclear. This study looked for the 
benign intervention of acupotomy in synovial pathology.
METHODS: The rabbits were divided into 3 groups, Normal group, KOA group, and 
KOA + Acupotomy (Apo) group, with 11 rabbits in each group. The KOA rabbit model 
was established by the modified Videman method with six weeks. The KOA + Apo 
group performed the intervention. The tendon insertion of vastus medialis, 
vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and anserine bursa were 
selected as treatment points in rabbits. Rabbits were treated once every 7 days 
for 3 weeks. We observed the intra-articular pressure and oxygen partial 
pressure (BOLD MRI). The synovial morphology was monitored by Hematoxylin-Eosin 
Staining (HE Staining). The expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription 
factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-1Î² 
(IL-1Î²) and tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) was detected using 
Immunohistochemical (IHC), Western Blot and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 
(ELISA).
RESULTS: Acupotomy reduced intra-articular hypertension and improved the 
synovial oxygen situation, synovial inflammatory and angiogenesis. HIF-1Î±, VEGF, 
IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± expression were downregulated by acupotomy.
CONCLUSION: Acupotomy may reduce inflammation and angiogenesis in KOA rabbit by 
reducing abnormally elevated intra-articular pressure and improving synovial 
oxygen environment. The above may provide a new theoretical foundation for 
acupotomy treatment of KOA.

BACKGROUND: Keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare disorder 
caused by hemichannel (HC) activating gain-of-function mutations in the GJB2 
gene encoding connexin (Cx) 26, for which there is no cure, or current 
treatments based upon the mechanism of disease causation.
METHODS: We applied Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) mediated mAb gene transfer 
(AAVmAb) to treat the epidermal features of KID syndrome with a 
well-characterized HC blocking antibody using male mice of a murine model that 
replicates the skin pathology of the human disease.
FINDINGS: We demonstrate that inÂ vivo AAVmAb treatment significantly reduced the 
size and thickness of KID lesions, in addition to blocking activity of mutant 
HCs in the epidermis inÂ vivo. We also show that AAVmAb treatment eliminated 
abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and enlarged cell size, decreased apoptosis, 
and restored the normal distribution of keratin expression.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings reinforce the critical role played by increased HC 
activity in the skin pathology associated with KID syndrome. They also 
underscore the clinical potential of anti-HC mAbs coupled with genetic based 
delivery systems for treating the underlying mechanistic basis of this disorder. 
Inhibition of HC activity is an ideal therapeutic target in KID syndrome, and 
the genetic delivery of mAbs targeted against mutant HCs could form the basis of 
new therapeutic interventions to treat this incurable disease.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is a common unifying factor in experimental models of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. Recent evidence suggests 
that housing temperature-driven alterations in hepatic inflammation correlate 
with exacerbated hepatic steatosis, development of hepatic fibrosis, and 
hepatocellular damage in a model of high fat diet-driven NAFLD. However, the 
congruency of these findings across other, frequently employed, experimental 
mouse models of NAFLD has not been studied.
METHODS: Here, we examine the impact of housing temperature on steatosis, 
hepatocellular damage, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH diet, 
methionine and choline deficient diet, and western diet + carbon tetrachloride 
experimental models of NAFLD in C57BL/6 mice.
RESULTS: We show that differences relevant to NAFLD pathology uncovered by 
thermoneutral housing include: (i) augmented NASH diet-driven hepatic immune 
cell accrual, exacerbated serum alanine transaminase levels and increased liver 
tissue damage as determined by NAFLD activity score; (ii) augmented methionine 
choline deficient diet-driven hepatic immune cell accrual and increased liver 
tissue damage as indicated by amplified hepatocellular ballooning, lobular 
inflammation, fibrosis and overall NAFLD activity score; and (iii) dampened 
western diet + carbon tetrachloride driven hepatic immune cell accrual and serum 
alanine aminotransferase levels but similar NAFLD activity score.
DISCUSSION: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that thermoneutral housing 
has broad but divergent effects on hepatic immune cell inflammation and 
hepatocellular damage across existing experimental NAFLD models in mice. These 
insights may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interrogations focused 
on immune cell function in shaping NAFLD progression.

OBJECTIVE: Reflex testing protocols allow clinical laboratories to perform 
second line diagnostic tests on existing specimens based on the results of 
initially ordered tests. Reflex testing can support optimal clinical laboratory 
test ordering and diagnosis. In current clinical practice, reflex testing 
typically relies on simple "if-then" rules; however, this limits their scope 
since most test ordering decisions involve more complexity than a simple rule 
will allow. Here, using the analyte ferritin as an example, we propose an 
alternative machine learning-based approach to "smart" reflex testing with a 
wider scope and greater impact than traditional rule-based approaches.
METHODS: Using patient data, we developed a machine learning model to predict 
whether a patient getting CBC testing will also have ferritin testing ordered, 
consider applications of this model to "smart" reflex testing, and evaluate the 
model by comparing its performance to possible rule-based approaches.
RESULTS: Our underlying machine learning models performed moderately well in 
predicting ferritin test ordering and demonstrated greater suitability to reflex 
testing than rule-based approaches. Using chart review, we demonstrate that our 
model may improve ferritin test ordering. Finally, as a secondary goal, we 
demonstrate that ferritin test results are missing not at random (MNAR), a 
finding with implications for unbiased imputation of missing test results.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning may provide a foundation for new types of reflex 
testing with enhanced benefits for clinical diagnosis and laboratory utilization 
management.

PURPOSE: To identify challenges and opportunities for the development of 
treatments for Usher syndrome (USH) type 1B.
METHODS: In September 2021, the Foundation Fighting Blindness hosted a virtual 
workshop of clinicians, academic and industry researchers, advocates, and 
affected individuals and their families to discuss the challenges and 
opportunities for USH1B treatment development.
RESULTS: The workshop began with insights from individuals affected by USH1B. 
Presentation topics included myosin VIIA protein function in the ear and eye and 
its role in disease pathology; challenges with the USH1B mouse model most used 
in disease research to date; new investigations into alternative disease models 
that may provide closer analogues to USH1B in the human retina, including 
retinal organoids and large animal models; and learnings from and limitations of 
available disease natural history data. Participants discussed the need for an 
open dialogue between researchers and regulators to design USH1B clinical trials 
with appropriate outcome measures of vision improvement, along with multimodal 
imaging of the retina and other testing approaches that can help inform trial 
designs. The workshop concluded with presentations and a roundtable reviewing 
emerging treatments, including USH1B-targeted genetic augmentation therapy and 
gene-agnostic approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives like this workshop are important to foster all 
stakeholders in support of achieving the shared goal of treating and curing 
USH1B.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Presentations and discussions focused on overcoming 
disease modeling and clinical trial design challenges to facilitate development, 
testing, and implementation of effective USH1B treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among older 
adults. APOE3 Christchurch (R136S, APOE3Ch ) variant homozygosity was reported 
in an individual with extreme resistance to autosomal dominant AD due to the 
PSEN1 E280A mutation. This subject had a delayed clinical age at onset and 
resistance to tauopathy and neurodegeneration despite extremely high amyloid 
plaque burden. We established induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived 
cerebral organoids from this resistant case and from a non-protected kindred 
control (with PSEN1 E280A and APOE3/3 ). We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to 
successfully remove the APOE3Ch to wild type in iPS cells from the protected 
case and to introduce the APOE3Ch as homozygote in iPS cells from the 
non-protected case to examine causality. We found significant reduction of tau 
phosphorylation (pTau 202/205 and pTau396) in cerebral organoids with the 
APOE3Ch variant, consistent with the strikingly reduced tau pathology found in 
the resistant case. We identified Cadherin and Wnt pathways as signaling 
mechanisms regulated by the APOE3Ch variant through single cell RNA sequencing 
in cerebral organoids. We also identified elevated Î²-catenin protein, a 
regulator of tau phosphorylation, as a candidate mediator of APOE3Ch resistance 
to tauopathy. Our findings show that APOE3Ch is necessary and sufficient to 
confer resistance to tauopathy in an experimental ex-vivo model establishing a 
foundation for the development of novel, protected case-inspired therapeutics 
for tauopathies, including Alzheimer's.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of 'brain-predicted age' quantify apparent brain age 
compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap 
(BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic 
Alzheimer disease (AD) but has not been well explored in presymptomatic AD. 
Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural MRI, but more recently 
other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, 
have been explored.
METHODS: We trained three models to predict age from FC, structural (S), or 
multimodal MRI (S+FC) in 390 amyloid-negative cognitively normal (CN/A-) 
participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 CN/A-, 154 CN/A+, 
and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships 
between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid and tau, as well as a global cognitive 
composite.
RESULTS: All models predicted age in the control training set, with the 
multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were 
significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG was significantly 
reduced in CN/A+ participants compared to CN/A-. In CI participants only, 
elevated S-BAG and S+FC BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and 
lower cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Both FC-BAG and S-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC 
and structural MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may 
capture a unique biphasic response to presymptomatic AD pathology, while S-BAG 
may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic 
stage. A multimodal age-prediction model improves sensitivity to healthy age 
differences.

Plain Language Summary: The brains of people with advanced Alzheimerâs disease 
often look older than expected based on the patientsâ actual age. This âbrain 
age gapâ (how old a brain appears compared to the personâs chronological age) 
can be calculated thanks to machine learning algorithms which analyse images of 
the organ to detect changes related to aging. Traditionally, these models have 
relied on images of the brain structure, such as the size and thickness of 
various brain areas; more recent models have started to use activity data, such 
as how different brain regions work together to form functional networks. While 
the brain age gap is a useful measure for researchers who investigate aging and 
disease, it is not yet helpful for clinicians. For example, it is unclear 
whether the machine learning algorithm could detect changes in the brains of 
individuals in the initial stages of Alzheimerâs disease, before they start to 
manifest cognitive symptoms. Millar et al. explored this question by testing 
whether models which incorporate structural and activity data could be more 
sensitive to these early changes. Three machine learning algorithms (relying on 
either structural data, activity data, or combination of both) were used to 
predict the brain ages of participants with no sign of disease; with biological 
markers of Alzheimerâs disease but preserved cognitive functions; and with 
marked cognitive symptoms of the condition. Overall, the combined model was 
slightly better at predicting the brain age of healthy volunteers, and all three 
models indicated that patients with dementia had a brain which looked older than 
normal. For this group, the model based on structural data was also able to make 
predictions which reflected the severity of cognitive decline. Crucially, the 
algorithm which used activity data predicted that, in individuals with 
biological markers of Alzheimerâs disease but no cognitive impairment, the brain 
looked in fact younger than chronological age. Exactly why this is the case 
remains unclear, but this signal may be driven by neural processes which unfold 
in the early stages of the disease. While more research is needed, the work by 
Millar et al. helps to explore how various types of machine learning models 
could one day be used to assess and predict brain health.

BACKGROUND: A considerable body of clinical evidence suggests that systemic 
dehydration can negatively affect voice production, leading to the common 
recommendation to rehydrate. Evidence for the corrective benefits of 
rehydration, however, is limited with mixed conclusions, and biological data on 
the underlying tissue changes with rehydration is lacking. In this study, we 
used a rabbit model (nÂ =Â 24) of acute (5Â days) water restriction-induced 
systemic dehydration with subsequent rehydration (3Â days) to explore the 
protein-level changes underlying the molecular transition from euhydration to 
dehydration and following rehydration using LC-MS/MS protein quantification in 
the vocal folds. We show that 5-day water restriction led to an average 4.3% 
decrease in body weight with relative increases in anion gap, Cl-, creatinine, 
Na+, and relative decreases in BUN, iCa2+, K+, and tCO2 compared to control 
(euhydrated) animals. A total of 309 differentially regulated (pÂ <Â 0.05) 
proteins were identified between the Control and Dehydration groups. We observed 
a noteworthy similarity between the Dehydration and Rehydration groups, both 
well differentiated from the Control group, highlighting the distinct timelines 
of resolution of the clinical symptoms of systemic dehydration and the 
underlying molecular changes.
SIGNIFICANCE: Voice disorders are a ubiquitous problem with considerable 
economic and psychological impact. Maintenance of proper hydration is commonly 
prescribed as a general vocal hygiene practice. There is evidence that 
dehydration negatively impacts phonation, but our understanding of the state of 
vocal folds in the context of systemic dehydration are limited, particular from 
a molecular perspective. Further, ours is a novel molecular study of the 
short-term impact of rehydration on the tissue. Given the relatively minimal 
difference in vocal fold proteomic profiles between the Dehydration and 
Rehydration groups, our data demonstrate a complex physiological response to 
acute systemic dehydration, and highlight the importance of considering 
persistent underlying molecular pathology despite the rapid resolution of 
clinical measures. This study sets a foundation for future research to confirm 
the nature of potential beneficial outcomes of clinical recommendations related 
to hydration.

BACKGROUND: Determining the origin of bone metastatic cancer (OBMC) is of great 
significance to clinical therapeutics. It is challenging for pathologists to 
determine the OBMC with limited clinical information and bone biopsy.
METHODS: We designed a regional multiple-instance learning algorithm to predict 
the OBMC based on hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining slides alone. We collected 
1041 cases from eight different hospitals and labeled 26,431 regions of interest 
to train the model. The performance of the model was assessed by ten-fold cross 
validation and external validation. Under the guidance of top3 predictions, we 
conducted an IHC test on 175 cases of unknown origins to compare the consistency 
of the results predicted by the model and indicated by the IHC markers. We also 
applied the model to identify whether there was tumor or not in a region, as 
well as distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and 
neuroendocrine tumor.
FINDINGS: In the within-cohort, our model achieved a top1-accuracy of 91.35% and 
a top3-accuracy of 97.75%. In the external cohort, our model displayed a good 
generalizability with a top3-accuracy of 97.44%. The top1 consistency between 
the results of the model and the immunohistochemistry markers was 83.90% and the 
top3 consistency was 94.33%. The model obtained an accuracy of 98.98% to 
identify whether there was tumor or not and an accuracy of 93.85% to 
differentiate three types of cancers.
INTERPRETATION: Our model demonstrated good performance to predict the OBMC from 
routine histology and had great potential for assisting pathologists with 
determining the OBMC accurately.

Conventionally, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is estimated as the amplitude 
of the hemodynamic response to vascular stimuli, most commonly carbon dioxide 
(CO2). While the CVR amplitude has established clinical utility, the temporal 
characteristics of CVR (dCVR) have been increasingly explored and may yield even 
more pathology-sensitive parameters. This work is motivated by the current need 
to evaluate the feasibility of dCVR modeling in various experimental conditions. 
In this work, we present a comparison of several recently published/utilized 
model-based deconvolution (response estimation) approaches for estimating the 
CO2 response function h(t), including maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP), 
inverse logit (IL), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and basis expansion 
(using Gamma and Laguerre basis sets). To aid the comparison, we devised a novel 
simulation framework that incorporates a wide range of SNRs, ranging from 10 to 
-7Â dB, representative of both task and resting-state CO2 changes. In addition, 
we built ground-truth h(t) into our simulation framework, overcoming the 
conventional limitation that the true h(t) is unknown. Moreover, to best 
represent realistic noise found in fMRI scans, we extracted noise from in-vivo 
resting-state scans. Furthermore, we introduce a simple optimization of the CCA 
method (CCAopt) and compare its performance to these existing methods. Our 
findings suggest that model-based methods can accurately estimate dCVR even 
amidst high noise (i.e. resting-state), and in a manner that is largely 
independent of the underlying model assumptions for each method. We also provide 
a quantitative basis for making methodological choices, based on the desired 
dCVR parameters, the estimation accuracy and computation time. The BEL method 
provided the highest accuracy and robustness, followed by the CCAopt and IL 
methods. Of the three, the CCAopt method has the lowest computational 
requirements. These findings lay the foundation for wider adoption of dCVR 
estimation in CVR mapping.

BACKGROUND: Patients with pancreatobiliary tract cancer usually have a poor 
clinical outcome, with a 5-year overall survival rate below 20%. This is mainly 
associated with the late diagnosis. In addition, the standard-of-care for 
patients with malignant biliary stenosis involves a major surgery, the Whipple 
procedure. An accurate preoperative diagnosis, including differentiation from 
benign diseases, is critical to avoid unnecessary treatment. Here we developed 
BileScreen, a sensitive detection modality for the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary 
tract cancer based on massively parallel sequencing mutation and methylation 
changes in bile samples.
METHODS: A total of 338 patients, from five hospitals in China, with 
pancreatobiliary system disorders were enrolled in this study between November 
2018 and October 2020, and 259 were included for the analysis of BileScreen. We 
profiled 23 gene mutations and 44 genes with methylation modifications in 
parallel from bile samples, and set up a model for the detection of malignancy 
based on multi-level biomarkers.
FINDINGS: We applied the BileScreen assay in a training cohort (nÂ =Â 104) to set 
up the model and algorithm. The model was further evaluated in a validation 
cohort (nÂ =Â 105), resulting in 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The 
performance of BileScreen was further assessed in a prospective test cohort 
(nÂ =Â 50) of patients diagnosed with suspicious or negative pathology by 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and were confirmed in follow-up. 
BileScreen yielded 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity, and outcompeted serum 
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in detecting pancreatobiliary tract cancer in all 
three cohorts, especially in terms of specificity.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, BileScreen has the ability to interrogate 
mutations and methylation changes in bile samples in parallel, thus rendering it 
a potentially sensitive detection method to help in the diagnosis of 
pancreatobiliary tract cancer in a safe, convenient and less-invasive manner.

AIMS: Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias can be severe presentations in patients 
with inherited defects of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid Î²-oxidation (FAO). 
The pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie these cardiac abnormalities 
remain largely unknown. We investigated the molecular adaptations to a FAO 
deficiency in the heart using the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) 
knockout (KO) mouse model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We observed enrichment of amino acid metabolic pathways and 
of ATF4 target genes among the upregulated genes in the LCAD KO heart 
transcriptome. We also found a prominent activation of the eIF2Î±/ATF4 axis at 
the protein level that was independent of the feeding status, in addition to a 
reduction of cardiac protein synthesis during a short period of food withdrawal. 
These findings are consistent with an activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR) in the LCAD KO mouse heart. Notably, charging of several transfer 
RNAs (tRNAs), such as tRNAGln was decreased in LCAD KO hearts, reflecting a 
reduced availability of cardiac amino acids, in particular, glutamine. We 
replicated the activation of the ISR in the hearts of mice with muscle-specific 
deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that perturbations in amino acid metabolism caused 
by long-chain FAO deficiency impact cardiac metabolic signalling, in particular 
the ISR. These results may serve as a foundation for investigating the role of 
the ISR in the cardiac pathology associated with long-chain FAO 
defects.Translational Perspective: The heart relies mainly on mitochondrial 
fatty acid Î²-oxidation (FAO) for its high energy requirements. The heart disease 
observed in patients with a genetic defect in this pathway highlights the 
importance of FAO for cardiac health. We show that the consequences of a FAO 
defect extend beyond cardiac energy homeostasis and include amino acid 
metabolism and associated signalling pathways such as the integrated stress 
response.

INTRODUCTION: Accurate demonstration of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein aggregation 
and propagation, progressive nigrostriatal degeneration and motor deficits will 
help further research on elucidating the mechanisms of Parkinson's Disease. 
Î±-synucleinN103 and tauN368, cleaved by activated asparagine endopeptidase in 
Parkinson's Disease, robustly interacted with each other and triggered 
endogenous Î±-synuclein accumulation in a strong manner. However, the detailed 
pathophysiological process caused by the complex remains to be established.
METHODS: In this study, rats were unilaterally inoculated with 15 or 30 Î¼g of 
this complex or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline, PBS). Over a 6-month period 
post injection, we then investigated the abundance of pSyn inclusions, 
nigrostriatal degeneration, and changes in axonal transport proteins to identify 
the various dynamic pathological changes caused by pSyn aggregates in the 
nigrostriatal system.
RESULTS: As expected, rats displayed a dose-dependent increase in the amount of 
Î±-synuclein inclusions, and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration was 
observed throughout the study, reaching 30% at 6 months post injection. 
Impairments in anterograde axonal transport, followed by retrograde transport, 
were observed prior to neuron death, which was first discovered in the PFFs 
model.
DISCUSSION: The current results demonstrate the value of a novel rat model of 
Parkinson's disease characterized by widespread, "seed"-initiated endogenous 
Î±-Syn pathology, impaired axonal transport, and a neurodegenerative cascade in 
the nigrostriatal system. Notably, the present study is the first to examine 
alterations in axonal transport proteins in a PFF model, providing an 
appropriate foundation for future research regarding the mechanisms leading to 
subsequent neurodegeneration. As this model recapitulates some essential 
features of Parkinson's disease, it provides an important platform for further 
research on specific pathogenic mechanisms and pre-clinical evaluations of novel 
therapeutic strategies.

People infected with the mosquito-borne Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) can 
suffer from eye-related problems resulting in ongoing vision issues or even 
permanent blindness. Despite ocular disease being the most frequently reported 
severe outcome, it is vastly understudied compared to other disease outcomes 
caused by RVFV. Ocular manifestations of RVFV include blurred vision, uveitis, 
and retinitis. When an infected individual develops macular or paramacular 
lesions, there is a 50% chance of permanent vision loss in one or both eyes. The 
cause of blinding ocular pathology remains unknown in part due to the lack of a 
tractable animal model. Using 3 relevant exposure routes, both subcutaneous (SC) 
and aerosol inoculation of Sprague Dawley rats led to RVFV infection of the eye. 
Surprisingly, direct inoculation of the conjunctiva did not result in successful 
ocular infection. The posterior segment of the eye, including the optic nerve, 
choroid, ciliary body, and retina, were all positive for RVFV antigen in 
SC-infected rats, and live virus was isolated from the eyes. Proinflammatory 
cytokines and increased leukocyte counts were also found in the eyes of infected 
rats. Additionally, human ocular cell lines were permissive for Lrp1-dependent 
RVFV infection. This study experimentally defines viral tropism of RVFV in the 
posterior segment of the rat eye and characterizes virally-mediated ocular 
inflammation, providing a foundation for evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics 
to protect against adverse ocular outcomes. IMPORTANCE Rift Valley fever virus 
(RVFV) infection leads to eye damage in humans in up to 10% of reported cases. 
Permanent blindness occurs in 50% of individuals with significant retinal 
scarring. Despite the prevalence and severity of this outcome, very little is 
known about the mechanisms of pathogenesis. We addressed this gap by developing 
a rodent model of ocular disease. Subcutaneous infection of Sprague Dawley rats 
resulted in infection of the uvea, retina, and optic nerve along with the 
induction of inflammation within the posterior eye. Infection of human ocular 
cells induced inflammatory responses and required host entry factors for RVFV 
infection similar to rodents. This work provides evidence of how RVFV infects 
the eye, and this information can be applied to help mitigate the devastating 
outcomes of RVF ocular disease through vaccines or treatments.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease 
(PD). The most common sites targeted for DBS in PD are the globus pallidus 
internal (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, STN-DBS and GPi-DBS have 
limited improvement in some symptoms and even aggravate disease symptoms. 
Therefore, discovering new targets is more helpful for treating refractory 
symptoms of PD. Therefore, our study selected a new brain region, the lateral 
globus pallidus (GP), as the target of DBS, and the study found that GP-DBS can 
improve motor symptoms. It has been reported that the thalamic parafascicular 
(PF) nucleus is strongly related to PD pathology. Moreover, the PF nucleus and 
GP have very close direct and indirect fiber connections. However, whether 
GP-DBS can change the activity of the PF remains unclear. Therefore, in this 
study, we monitored the activity changes in the PF nucleus in PD rats during a 
quiet awake state after GP-DBS. We found that GP-DBS could reverse the 
electrical activity of the PF nucleus in PD model rats, including the discharge 
pattern of the neurons and the local field potential (0.7-12 and 12-70 Hz). 
Based on the results mentioned above, PF activity in PD model rats could be 
changed by GP-DBS. Thus, the normalization of PF neuronal activity may be a 
potential mechanism for GP-DBS in the treatment of PD; these findings lay the 
foundation for PD treatment strategies.

The endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 is a central player in the molecular 
mechanisms leading to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 
(BFCN), a long-standing target for drug development. As p38Î± is a Rab5 
activator, we hypothesized that inhibition of this kinase holds potential as an 
approach to treat diseases associated with BFCN loss. Herein, we report that 
neflamapimod (oral small molecule p38Î± inhibitor) reduces Rab5 activity, 
reverses endosomal pathology, and restores the numbers and morphology of BFCNs 
in a mouse model that develops BFCN degeneration. We also report on the results 
of an exploratory (hypothesis-generating) phase 2a randomized double-blind 
16-week placebo-controlled clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: 
NCT04001517/EudraCT #2019-001566-15) of neflamapimod in mild-to-moderate 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease in which BFCN degeneration is an 
important driver of disease expression. A total of 91 participants, all 
receiving background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, were randomized 1:1 
between neflamapimod 40âmg or matching placebo capsules (taken orally 
twice-daily if weight <80âkg or thrice-daily if weight >80âkg). Neflamapimod 
does not show an effect in the clinical study on the primary endpoint, a 
cognitive-test battery. On two secondary endpoints, a measure of functional 
mobility and a dementia rating-scale, improvements were seen that are consistent 
with an effect on BFCN function. Neflamapimod treatment is well-tolerated with 
no study drug associated treatment discontinuations. The combined preclinical 
and clinical observations inform on the validity of the Rab5-based pathogenic 
model of cholinergic degeneration and provide a foundation for confirmatory 
(hypothesis-testing) clinical evaluation of neflamapimod in DLB.

Traditionally, immune-mediated pathology is considered to result from 
hyperactivity of the immune system. In recent years, however, it has become 
apparent that, paradoxically, immunopathology can also occur as a consequence of 
impaired, immune reactions. This insight has important consequences. In the case 
of hyperactivity, immune suppression is the method of choice for therapy. By 
contrast, patients suffering from immunopathology as a consequence of impaired 
immune reactions may benefit instead from immune stimulation or immune 
reconstitution. This concept is what we call the "IMPATH paradox." The 
scientific and clinical impact of the IMPATH paradox is the focus of the 
collaborative research center CRC1160, funded by the German Research Foundation 
(DFG) since 2015. The CRC examines human and murine model situations, in which 
the causal link between impaired immune reactions and immunopathology can be 
explored and better mechanistically defined. In this series of review articles, 
we wish to place some of these models into the context of the IMPATH paradox and

INTRODUCTION: Lactation is a hormonally controlled process that promotes infant 
growth and neurodevelopment and reduces the long-term maternal risk of diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Hormones, such as prolactin and 
progesterone, mediate mammary development during pregnancy and are critical for 
initiating copious milk secretion within 24-72âhours post partum. However, the 
hormone concentrations mediating lactation onset are ill defined.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The primary objective of the investigating hormones 
triggering the onset of sustained lactation study is to establish reference 
intervals for the circulating hormone concentrations initiating postpartum milk 
secretion. The study will also assess how maternal factors such as parity, 
pregnancy comorbidities and complications during labour and delivery, which are 
known to delay lactation, may affect hormone concentrations. This single-centre 
observational study will recruit up to 1068 pregnant women over a 3-year period. 
A baseline blood sample will be obtained at 36 weeks' gestation. Participants 
will be monitored during postpartum days 1-4. Lactation onset will be reported 
using a validated breast fullness scale. Blood samples will be collected before 
and after a breastfeed on up to two occasions per day during postpartum days 
1-4. Colostrum, milk and spot urine samples will be obtained on a single 
occasion. Serum hormone reference intervals will be calculated as meanÂ±1.96âSD, 
with 90% CIs determined for the upper and lower reference limits. Differences in 
hormone values between healthy breastfeeding women and those at risk of delayed 
onset of lactation will be assessed by repeated measures two-way analysis of 
variance or a mixed linear model. Correlations between serum hormone 
concentrations and milk composition and volume will provide insights into the 
endocrine regulation of milk synthesis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for this study had been granted by the East 
of England-Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee (REC No. 
20/EE/0172), by the Health Research Authority (HRA), and by the Oxford 
University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. The findings will 
be published in high-ranking journals and presented at national and 
international conferences.

Clostridioides difficile infection is a global health threat and remains the 
primary cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide. The burgeoning 
incidence and severity of infections coupled with high rates of recurrence have 
created an urgent need for novel therapeutics. Here, we report a novel natural 
product scaffold as a potential anticlostridial lead with antivirulence 
properties and potent activity both in vitro and in vivo. A whole cell 
phenotypic screening of 1,000 purified natural products identified 6 compounds 
with potent activity against C. difficile (minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) range from 0.03 to 2 Î¼g/ml). All these 6 compounds were non-toxic to human 
colorectal cells. The natural product compounds also inhibited the production of 
key toxins, TcdA and TcdB, the key virulence determinants of C. difficile 
infection pathology. Additionally, the compounds exhibited rapid bactericidal 
activity and were superior to the standard-of-care antibiotic vancomycin, in 
reducing a high inoculum of C. difficile in vitro. Furthermore, a murine model 
of C. difficile infection revealed that compound NP-003875 conferred 100% 
protection to the infected mice from clinical manifestations of the disease. 
Collectively, the current study lays the foundation for further investigation of 
the natural product NP-003875 as a potential therapeutic choice for C. difficile 
infection.

Cornuside is an iridoid glycoside from Cornus officinalis, with the activities 
of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
neuroprotection. In the present research, a triple-transgenic mice model of AD 
(3 Ã Tg-AD) was used to explore the beneficial actions and potential mechanism 
of cornuside on the memory deficits. We found that cornuside prominently 
alleviated neuronal injuries, reduced amyloid plaque pathology, inhibited Tau 
phosphorylation, and repaired synaptic damage. Additionally, cornuside lowered 
the release of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis 
factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and nitric oxide (NO), lowered the level of malondialdehyde 
(MDA), and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the level of 
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Cornuside also significantly reduced the 
activation of astrocytes and modulated A1/A2 phenotypes by the AKT/Nrf2/NF-ÎºB 
signaling pathway. We further confirmed that LY294002 and Nrf2 silencing could 
block the cornuside-mediated phenotypic switch of C6 cells induced by microglia 
conditioned medium (MCM) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which 
indicated that the effects of cornuside in astrocyte activation are dependent on 
AKT/Nrf2/NF-ÎºB signaling. In conclusion, cornuside may regulate the phenotypic 
conversion of astrocytes, inhibit neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, 
improve synaptic plasticity, and alleviate cognitive impairment in mice through 
the AKT/Nrf2/NF-ÎºB axis. Our present work provides an experimental foundation 
for further research and development of cornuside as a candidate drug for AD 
management.

Intestinal dysfunction is frequently driven by abnormalities of specific genes, 
microbiota, or microenvironmental factors, which usually differ across 
individuals, as do intestinal physiology and pathology. Therefore, it's 
necessary to develop personalized therapeutic strategies, which are currently 
limited by the lack of a simulated intestine model. The mature human intestinal 
mucosa is covered by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells that are 
derived from intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The complexity of the organ 
dramatically increases the difficulty of faithfully mimicking in vivo 
microenvironments. However, a simulated intestine model will serve as an 
indispensable foundation for personalized drug screening. In this article, we 
review the advantages and disadvantages of conventional 2-dimensional models, 
intestinal organoid models, and current microfluidic intestine-on-a-chip (IOAC) 
models. The main technological strategies are summarized, and an advanced 
microfluidic primary IOAC model is proposed for personalized intestinal 
medicine. In this model, primary ISCs and the microbiome are isolated from 
individuals and co-cultured in a multi-channel microfluidic chip to establish a 
microengineered intestine device. The device can faithfully simulate in vivo 
fluidic flow, peristalsis-like motions, host-microbe crosstalk, and multi-cell 
type interactions. Moreover, the ISCs can be genetically edited before seeding, 
and monitoring sensors and post-analysis abilities can also be incorporated into 
the device to achieve high-throughput and rapid pharmaceutical studies. We also 
discuss the potential future applications and challenges of the microfluidic 
platform. The development of cell biology, biomaterials, and tissue engineering 
will drive the advancement of the simulated intestine, making a significant 
contribution to personalized medicine in the future. Graphical abstract The 
intestine is a primary organ for digestion, absorption, and metabolism, as well 
as a major site for the host-commensal microbiota interaction and mucosal 
immunity. The complexity of the organ dramatically increases the difficulty of 
faithfully mimicking in vivo microenvironments, though physiological 
3-dimensional of the native small intestinal epithelial tissue has been well 
documented.Â An intestinal stem cells-based microfluidic intestine-on-a-chip 
model that faithfully simulate in vivo fluidic flow, peristalsis-like motions, 
host-microbe crosstalk, and multi-cell type interactions will make a significant 
contribution.

The heterogeneous pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a barrier 
to advancing diagnostics and therapeutics, including targeted drug delivery. We 
used a unique discovery pipeline to identify novel targeting motifs that 
recognize specific temporal phases of TBI pathology. This pipeline combined in 
vivo biopanning with domain antibody (dAb) phage display, next-generation 
sequencing analysis, and peptide synthesis. We identified targeting motifs based 
on the complementarity-determining region 3 structure of dAbs for acute (1 day 
post-injury) and subacute (7 days post-injury) post-injury time points in a 
preclinical TBI model (controlled cortical impact). Bioreactivity and temporal 
sensitivity of the targeting motifs were validated via immunohistochemistry. 
Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry indicated that the acute TBI targeting 
motif recognized targets associated with metabolic and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, whereas the subacute TBI motif was largely associated with 
neurodegenerative processes. This pipeline successfully discovered temporally 
specific TBI targeting motif/epitope pairs that will serve as the foundation for 
the next-generation targeted TBI therapeutics and diagnostics.

Existing diagnostic methods are limited to observing appearance and demeanor, 
even though genetic factors play important roles in the pathology of 
schizophrenia. Indeed, no molecular-level test exists to assist diagnosis, which 
has limited treatment strategies. To address this serious shortcoming, we used a 
bioinformatics approach to identify 61 genes that are differentially expressed 
in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy controls. In particular, 
competing endogenous RNA network revealed the important role of the gene RASD2, 
which is regulated by miR-4763-3p. Indeed, analysis of blood samples confirmed 
that RASD2 is downregulated in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, positron 
emission tomography data collected for 44 human samples identified the 
prefrontal and temporal lobes as potential key brain regions in schizophrenia 
patients. Mechanistic studies indicated that miR-4763-3p inhibits RASD2 by 
base-pairing with the 3' untranslated region of RASD2 mRNA. Importantly, RASD2 
has been shown to interact with Î²-arrestin2, which contributes to the regulation 
of the DRD2-dependent CREB response element-binding protein pathway in the 
dopamine system. Finally, results obtained with a mouse model of schizophrenia 
revealed that inhibition of miR-4763-3p function alleviated anxiety symptoms and 
improved memory. The dopamine transporters in the striatal regions were 
significantly reduced in schizophrenia model mice as compared with wild-type 
mice, suggesting that inhibition of miR-4763-3p can lessen the symptoms of 
schizophrenia. Our findings demonstrate that miR-4763-3p may target RASD2 mRNA 
and thus may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for 
schizophrenia, providing a theoretical foundation for further studies of the 
molecular basis of this disease.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) model to predict DNA 
mismatch repair (MMR) status in colorectal cancers (CRC) based on hematoxylin 
and eosin-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) and assess its clinical 
applicability.
METHODS: The DL model was developed and validated through three-fold cross 
validation using 441 WSIs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and externally 
validated using 78 WSIs from the Pathology AI Platform (PAIP), and 355 WSIs from 
surgical specimens and 341 WSIs from biopsy specimens of the Sun Yet-sun 
University Cancer Center (SYSUCC). Domain adaption and multiple instance 
learning (MIL) techniques were adopted for model development. The performance of 
the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). A dual-threshold strategy was also built from the 
surgical cohorts and validated in the biopsy cohort. Sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1-score, and 
the percentage of patients avoiding IHC testing were evaluated.
FINDINGS: The MIL model achieved an AUROC of 0Â·8888Â±0Â·0357 in the 
TCGA-validation cohort, 0Â·8806Â±0Â·0232 in the PAIP cohort, 0Â·8457Â±0Â·0233 in the 
SYSUCC-surgical cohort, and 0Â·7679Â±0Â·0342 in the SYSUCC-biopsy cohort. A 
dual-threshold triage strategy was used to rule-in and rule-out dMMR patients 
with remaining uncertain patients recommended for further IHC testing, which 
kept sensitivity higher than 90% and specificity higher than 95% on deficient 
MMR patient triage from both the surgical and biopsy specimens, result in more 
than half of patients avoiding IHC based MMR testing.
INTERPRETATION: A DL-based method that could directly predict CRC MMR status 
from WSIs was successfully developed, and a dual-threshold triage strategy was 
established to minimize the number of patients for further IHC testing.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with 
high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. The common variants of specific 
oxytocin-related genes (OTRGs), particularly OXTR, are associated with the 
aetiology of ASD. The contribution of rare genetic variations in OTRGs to ASD 
aetiology remains unclear.
METHODS: We catalogued publicly available de novo mutations (DNMs) [from 6,511 
patients with ASD and 3,391 controls], rare inherited variants (RIVs) [from 
1,786 patients with ASD and 1,786 controls], and both de novo copy number 
variations (dnCNVs) and inherited CNVs (ihCNVs) [from 15,581 patients with ASD 
and 6,017 controls] in 963 curated OTRGs to explore their contribution to ASD 
pathology, respectively. Finally, a combined model was designed to prioritise 
the contribution of each gene to ASD aetiology by integrating DNMs and CNVs.
FINDINGS: The rare genetic variations of OTRGs were significantly associated 
with ASD aetiology, in the order of dnCNVs > ihCNVs > DNMs. Furthermore, 172 
OTRGs and their connected 286 ASD core genes were prioritised to positively 
contribute to ASD aetiology, including top-ranked MAPK3. Probands carrying rare 
disruptive variations in these genes were estimated to account for 10â¼11% of all 
ASD probands.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that rare disruptive variations in 172 
OTRGs and their connected 286 ASD core genes are associated with ASD aetiology 
and may be potential biomarkers predicting the effects of oxytocin treatment.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is an underestimated neglected tropical disease 
which affects over 236.6 million people worldwide. According to the CDC, the 
impact of this disease is second to only malaria as the most devastating 
parasitic infection. Affected individuals manifest chronic pathology due to egg 
granuloma formation, destroying the liver over time. The only FDA approved drug, 
praziquantel, does not protect individuals from reinfection, highlighting the 
need for a prophylactic vaccine. Schistosoma mansoni Cathepsin B (SmCB) is a 
parasitic gut peptidase necessary for helminth growth and maturation and confers 
protection as a vaccine target for intestinal schistosomiasis.
METHODS: An SmCB expressing human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdSmCB) was constructed 
and delivered intramuscularly to female C57BL/6 mice in a heterologous prime and 
boost vaccine with recombinant protein. Vaccine induced immunity was described 
and subsequent protection from parasite infection was assessed by analysing 
parasite burden and liver pathology.
FINDINGS: Substantially higher humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, 
consisting of IgG2c, Th1 effectors, and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells, were 
induced by the heterologous administration of AdSmCB when compared to the other 
regimens. Though immune responses favoured Th1 immunity, Th2 responses provided 
by SmCB protein boosts were maintained. This mixed Th1/Th2 immune response 
resulted in significant protection from S. mansoni infection comparable to other 
vaccine formulations which are in clinical trials. Schistosomiasis associated 
liver pathology was also prevented in a murine model.
INTERPRETATION: Our study provides missing preclinical data supporting the use 
of adenoviral vectoring in vaccines for S. mansoni infection. Our vaccination 
method significantly reduces parasite burden and its associated liver pathology 
- both of which are critical considerations for this helminth vaccine.

BACKGROUND: Agomelatine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of 
depression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects 
have yet to be elucidated. Identification of these molecular mechanisms would 
not only offer new insights into the basis for depression but also provide the 
foundation for the development of novel treatments for this disorder.
METHODS: Intraperitoneal injection of LPS was used to induce depression-like 
behaviors in rats. The interactions of the 5-HT2C reporter and GÎ±i-2 were 
verified by immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence assay. Inflammatory 
related proteins, autophagy related proteins and apoptosis markers were verified 
by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence assay. Finally, electron microscopy 
analysis was used to observe the synapse and ultrastructural pathology.
RESULTS: Here, we found that the capacity for agomelatine to ameliorate 
depression and anxiety in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat model of 
depression was associated with an alleviation of neuroinflammation, abnormal 
autophagy and neuronal apoptosis as well as the promotion of neurogenesis in the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region of these rats. We also found that the 
5-HT2C receptor is coupled with G alphai (2) (GÎ±i-2) protein within hippocampal 
neurons and, agomelatine, acting as a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, can 
up-regulate activity of the GÎ±i-2-cAMP-PKA pathway. Such events then suppress 
activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway, a member 
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family involved in pathological 
processes of many diseases.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that agomelatine plays a 
neuroprotective role in regulating neuroinflammation, autophagy disorder and 
apoptosis in this LPS-induced rat model of depression, effects which are 
associated with the display of antidepressant behaviors. These findings provide 
evidence for some of the potential mechanisms for the antidepressant effects of 
agomelatine.

BackgroundSome clinical features of severe COVID-19 represent blood vessel 
damage induced by activation of host immune responses initiated by the 
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized autoantibodies against 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor expressed on 
vascular endothelium, are generated during COVID-19 and are of mechanistic 
importance.MethodsIn an opportunity sample of 118 COVID-19 inpatients, 
autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 were detected by ELISA. Binding properties of 
anti-ACE2 IgM were analyzed via biolayer interferometry. Effects of anti-ACE2 
IgM on complement activation and endothelial function were demonstrated in a 
tissue-engineered pulmonary microvessel model.ResultsAnti-ACE2 IgM (not IgG) 
autoantibodies were associated with severe COVID-19 and found in 18/66 (27.2%) 
patients with severe disease compared with 2/52 (3.8%) of patients with moderate 
disease (OR 9.38, 95% CI 2.38-42.0; P = 0.0009). Anti-ACE2 IgM autoantibodies 
were rare (2/50) in non-COVID-19 ventilated patients with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. Unexpectedly, ACE2-reactive IgM autoantibodies in COVID-19 
did not undergo class-switching to IgG and had apparent KD values of 5.6-21.7 
nM, indicating they are T cell independent. Anti-ACE2 IgMs activated complement 
and initiated complement-binding and functional changes in endothelial cells in 
microvessels, suggesting they contribute to the angiocentric pathology of 
COVID-19.ConclusionWe identify anti-ACE2 IgM as a mechanism-based biomarker 
strongly associated with severe clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which 
has therapeutic implications.FUNDINGBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates

BACKGROUND: Neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline and depression 
contribute substantially to post-COVID-19 syndrome, defined as lasting symptoms 
several weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenesis is still 
elusive, which hampers appropriate treatment. Neuroinflammatory responses and 
neurodegenerative processes may occur in absence of overt neuroinvasion.
METHODS: Here we determined whether intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in male and 
female syrian golden hamsters results in persistent brain pathology. Brains 3 
(symptomatic) or 14 days (viral clearance) post infection versus mock (nÂ =Â 10 
each) were immunohistochemically analyzed for viral protein, neuroinflammatory 
response and accumulation of tau, hyperphosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein 
protein.
FINDINGS: Viral protein in the nasal cavity led to pronounced microglia 
activation in the olfactory bulb beyond viral clearance. Cortical but not 
hippocampal neurons accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein, in 
the absence of overt inflammation and neurodegeneration. Importantly, not all 
brain regions were affected, which is in line with selective vulnerability.
INTERPRETATION: Thus, despite the absence of virus in brain, neurons develop 
signatures of proteinopathies that may contribute to progressive neuronal 
dysfunction. Further in depth analysis of this important mechanism is required.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate preoperative predictions of seizure freedom following 
surgery for focal drug resistant epilepsy remain elusive. Our objective was to 
systematically evaluate all meta-analyses of epilepsy surgery with seizure 
freedom as the primary outcome, to identify clinical features that are 
consistently prognostic and should be included in the future models.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Cochrane using free-text and Medical Subject 
Heading (MeSH) terms according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses. This study was registered on PROSPERO. We classified 
features as prognostic, non-prognostic and uncertain and into seven 
subcategories: 'clinical', 'imaging', 'neurophysiology', 'multimodal 
concordance', 'genetic', 'surgical technique' and 'pathology'. We propose a 
structural causal model based on these features.
RESULTS: We found 46 features from 38 meta-analyses over 22 years. The following 
were consistently prognostic across meta-analyses: febrile convulsions, 
hippocampal sclerosis, focal abnormal MRI, Single-Photon Emission Computed 
Tomography (SPECT) coregistered to MRI, focal ictal/interictal EEG, EEG-MRI 
concordance, temporal lobe resections, complete excision, histopathological 
lesions, tumours and focal cortical dysplasia type IIb. Severe learning 
disability was predictive of poor prognosis. Others, including sex and side of 
resection, were non-prognostic. There were limited meta-analyses investigating 
genetic contributions, structural connectivity or multimodal concordance and few 
adjusted for known confounders or performed corrections for multiple 
comparisons.
SIGNIFICANCE: Seizure-free outcomes have not improved over decades of epilepsy 
surgery and despite a multitude of models, none prognosticate accurately. Our 
list of multimodal population-invariant prognostic features and proposed 
structural causal model may serve as an objective foundation for statistical 
adjustments of plausible confounders for use in high-dimensional models.

Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) can cause life-threatening 
community-acquired infections among healthy young individuals and is thus of 
concern for global dissemination. In this study, a mouse model of acute primary 
hvKp pneumonia was established via aerosolized intratracheal (i.t.) inoculation, 
laying the foundation for conducting extensive studies related to hvKp. 
Subsequently, a time-course transcriptional profile was created of the lungs 
from the mouse model at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 60 hours post-infection (hpi) using 
RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA-Seq data were analyzed with the use of Mfuzz time 
clustering, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Immune Cell 
Abundance Identifier for mouse (ImmuCellAI-mouse). A gradual change in the 
transcriptional profile of the lungs was observed that reflected expected 
disease progression. At 12 hpi, genes related to acute phase inflammatory 
response increased in expression and lipid metabolism appeared to have a 
pro-inflammatory effect. At 24 hpi, exacerbation of inflammation was observed 
and active IFN-Î³ suggested that signaling promoted activation and recruitment of 
macrophages occurred. Genes related to maintaining the structural integrity of 
lung tissues showed a sustained decrease in expression after infection and the 
decrease was especially marked at 48 hpi. TNF, IL-17, MAPK and NF-kB signaling 
pathways may play key roles in the immunopathogenesis mechanism at all stages of 
infection. Natural killer (NK) cells consistently decreased in abundance after 
infection, which has rarely been reported in hvKp infection and could provide a 
new target for treatment. Genes Saa1 and Slpi were significantly upregulated 
during infection. Both Saa1, which is associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
that elicits host inflammatory response, and Slpi, which encodes an 
antimicrobial protein, have not previously been reported in hvKp infections and 
could be important targets for subsequent studies. To t our knowledge, this 
paper represents the first study to investigate the pulmonary transcriptional 
response to hvKp infection. The results provide new insights into the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hvKp pulmonary infection that can 
contribute to the development of therapies to reduce hvKp pneumonia.

Across neurodegenerative diseases, common mechanisms may reveal novel 
therapeutic targets based on neuronal protection, repair, or regeneration, 
independent of etiology or site of disease pathology. To address these 
mechanisms and discuss emerging treatments, in April, 2021, Glaucoma Research 
Foundation, BrightFocus Foundation, and the Melza M. and Frank Theodore Barr 
Foundation collaborated to bring together key opinion leaders and experts in the 
field of neurodegenerative disease for a virtual meeting titled "Solving 
Neurodegeneration". This "think-tank" style meeting focused on uncovering common 
mechanistic roots of neurodegenerative disease and promising targets for new 
treatments, catalyzed by the goal of finding new treatments for glaucoma, the 
world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and the common interest of the 
three hosting foundations. Glaucoma, which causes vision loss through 
degeneration of the optic nerve, likely shares early cellular and molecular 
events with other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. Here 
we discuss major areas of mechanistic overlap between neurodegenerative diseases 
of the central nervous system: neuroinflammation, bioenergetics and metabolism, 
genetic contributions, and neurovascular interactions. We summarize important 
discussion points with emphasis on the research areas that are most innovative 
and promising in the treatment of neurodegeneration yet require further 
development. The research that is highlighted provides unique opportunities for 
collaboration that will lead to efforts in preventing neurodegeneration and 
ultimately vision loss.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of exertional 
heat stroke (EHS) with a complex pathogenesis. We established a stable mouse 
model of EHS-related AKI (EHS-AKI).
METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice were divided into 6 groups: Saline Control group, 
Glycerol Control group, Saline + Sham heat exercise (SHE) group, Saline + Heat 
exercise (HE) group, Glycerol + SHE group, and Glycerol + HE group. Samples from 
the Saline Control group and the Glycerol Control group were taken 6 h after the 
intramuscular injection of saline (4 mL/kg) or glycerol (4 mL/kg) to provide a 
baseline for comparisons with the other 4 groups. The other 4 groups of mice 
started exercise 6 h after the intramuscular injection of saline or glycerol, 
and were sacrificed to collect samples after exercise. Finally, serum and the 
pathology of kidney and muscle tissues were quantified.
RESULTS: There were no differences in the creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin (MYO) levels, but the interleukin 6 
(IL-6) level was more increased (P<0.05) in the Glycerol Control group than the 
Saline Control group at the baseline. The IL-6 levels of the Glycerol + HE group 
were also higher than those of the Saline + HE groups at 6 and 12 h (P<0.05). 
The Cr levels at 12 h and 1 day, the BUN levels at 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, and 2 days 
in the Glycerol+ HE group were higher than the baseline levels (P<0.05). And the 
renal pathological scores at 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days were 0.79, 
1.29, 1.58, 0.85, and 0.77. However, there was only slight renal pathological 
injury in the Saline + HE group at 12 h, and 1 day, and the scores were 0.13, 
and 0.41. The CK level in each group all peaked at 6 h after exercise and higher 
than the baseline (P<0.05). However, there was no difference in the MYO levels 
of each group compared to the baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a stable mouse model of EHS-AKI by conducting a heat 
exercise after the intramuscular injection of glycerol. Our findings lay the 
foundation for follow-up clinical and basic research.

AIM: To predict survival time of Korean hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients 
using multi-center data as a foundation for the development of a predictive 
artificial intelligence model according to treatment methods based on machine 
learning.
METHODS: Data of patients who underwent treatment for HCC from 2008 to 2015 was 
provided by Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and Korea Central Cancer Registry. A 
total of 10,742 patients with HCC were divided into two groups, with Group I 
(2920 patients) confirmed on biopsy and Group II (5562 patients) diagnosed as 
HCC according to HCC diagnostic criteria as outlined in Korean Liver Cancer 
Association guidelines. The data were modeled according to features of patient 
clinical characteristics. Features effective in predicting survival rate were 
analyzed retrospectively. Various machine learning methods were used.
RESULTS: Target was overall survival time, which divided into approximately 
60Â months (=â/<â60Â m, >â60Â m). Target distribution in Group I (total 514 
samples) was 28.8%: (148 samples) less than 60Â months, 71.2% (366 samples) 
greater than 60Â months, and in Group II (total 757 samples) was 66.6% (504 
samples) less than 60Â months, 33.4% (253 samples) greater than 60Â months. Using 
NG Boost method, its accuracy was 83%, precision 84%, sensitivity 95%, and F1 
score 89% for more than 60Â months survival time in Group I with surgical 
resection. Moreover, its accuracy was 79%, precision 82%, sensitivity 87%, and 
F1 score 84% for less than 60Â months survival time in Group II with TACE. The 
feature importance with gain criterion indicated that pathology, portal vein 
invasion, surgery, metastasis, and needle biopsy features could be explained as 
important factors for prediction in case of biopsy (Group I).
CONCLUSION: By developing a predictive model using machine learning algorithms 
to predict prognosis of HCC patients, it is possible to project optimized 
treatment by case according to liver function and tumor status.

BACKGROUNDProstate cancer is multifocal with distinct molecular subtypes. The 
utility of genomic subtyping has been challenged due to inter- and intrafocal 
heterogeneity. We sought to characterize the subtype-defining molecular 
alterations of primary prostate cancer across all tumor foci within radical 
prostatectomy (RP) specimens and determine the prevalence of collision 
tumors.METHODSFrom the Early Detection Research Network cohort, we identified 
333 prospectively collected RPs from 2010 to 2014 and assessed ETS-related gene 
(ERG), serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), phosphatase and tensin 
homolog (PTEN), and speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) molecular status. We 
utilized dual ERG/SPINK1 immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization to confirm ERG rearrangements and characterize PTEN deletion, as 
well as high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing to 
determine SPOP mutation status.RESULTSBased on index focus alone, ERG, SPINK1, 
PTEN, and SPOP alterations were identified in 47.5%, 10.8%, 14.3%, and 5.1% of 
RP specimens, respectively. In 233 multifocal RPs with ERG/SPINK1 status in all 
foci, 139 (59.7%) had discordant molecular alterations between foci. Collision 
tumors, as defined by discrepant ERG/SPINK1 status within a single focus, were 
identified in 29 (9.4%) RP specimens.CONCLUSIONInterfocal molecular 
heterogeneity was identified in about 60% of multifocal RP specimens, and 
collision tumors were present in about 10%. We present this phenomenon as a 
model for the intrafocal heterogeneity observed in previous studies and propose 
that future genomic studies screen for collision tumors to better characterize 
molecular heterogeneity.FUNDINGEarly Detection Research Network US National

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive 
neurodegenerative disease that places a substantial burden on patients and 
caregivers. Aducanumab is the first AD therapy approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration to reduce a defining pathophysiological feature of the disease, 
brain amyloid plaques. In the phase 3 clinical trial EMERGE (NCT02484547), 
aducanumab reduced clinical decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia and confirmed amyloid pathology.
METHODS: We used a Markov modeling approach to predict the long-term clinical 
benefits of aducanumab for patients with early AD based on EMERGE efficacy data. 
In the model, patients could transition between AD severity levels (MCI due to 
AD; mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia) and care settings (community vs. 
institution) or transition to death. The intervention was aducanumab added to 
standard of care (SOC), and the comparator was SOC alone. Data sources for 
base-case and scenario analyses included EMERGE, published National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center analyses, and other published literature.
RESULTS: Per patient over a lifetime horizon, aducanumab treatment corresponded 
to 0.65 incremental patient quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 0.09 fewer 
caregiver QALYs lost compared with patients treated with SOC. Aducanumab 
treatment translated to a lower lifetime probability of transitioning to AD 
dementia, a lower lifetime probability of transitioning to institutionalization 
(25.2% vs. 29.4%), delays in the median time to transition to AD dementia (7.50 
vs. 4.92Â years from MCI to moderate AD dementia or worse), and an incremental 
median time in the community of 1.32Â years compared with SOC.
CONCLUSION: The model predicted long-term benefits of aducanumab treatment in 
patients with MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia and their caregivers. The 
predicted outcomes provide a foundation for healthcare decision-makers and 
policymakers to understand the potential clinical and socioeconomic value of 
aducanumab.

CONTEXT.â: Specific reference intervals (RIs) facilitate accurate interpretation 
of results. Coagulation assay results may vary by demographics and also between 
reagents and analyzers used. Current Thromboelastograph 6s (TEG 6s) Hemostasis 
Analyzer RIs were generated from adult samples.
OBJECTIVE.â: To generate reagent analyzer-specific pediatric RIs for TEG 6s and 
coagulation parameters.
DESIGN.â: A prospective, observational, single-center study of healthy children 
undergoing general anesthesia (January 3, 2017 to January 3, 2019). Venous blood 
samples were obtained for TEG 6s (Kaolin, Kaolin-Heparinase, Rapid and 
Functional Fibrinogen assays) and coagulation parameters (activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin clotting time, Echis time, 
antithrombin activity, and fibrinogen concentration using Instrumentation 
Laboratory ACL-TOP analyzers). Differences between activated partial 
thromboplastin time and prothrombin time reagents were investigated using 
mixed-effects regression, comparing maximum coefficients-of-variation with 
assay-specific allowable variation. RIs (lower/upper limits 2.5th of 97.5th 
percentiles) were generated using the following 2 methods: within discrete 
age-groups (neonates [<1 month], infants [1 month-1 year], young children [1-5 
years], older children [6-10 years], and adolescents [11-16 years]), and modeled 
as functions of age and/or sex using quantile regression, including significant 
fractional polynomial and interaction terms.
RESULTS.â: Variation between prothrombin time and activated partial 
thromboplastin time assays using different reagents was clinically significant. 
Reagent-analyzer specific pediatric RIs were generated using data from 254 
children. Discrete and model-based RIs varied by age for all coagulation 
parameters and TEG 6s variables in all assays.
CONCLUSIONS.â: We report reagent-analyzer specific pediatric RIs for TEG 6s and 
coagulation parameters. Observed variation reinforces recommendations for 
laboratory-specific RIs. These findings improve accuracy of interpretation of 
clinical results, provide a foundation for comparison and validation of tests in 
pathology, and illustrate feasibility and advantages of model-based RI 
approaches.

Regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited by the presence of a 
glial scar and inhibitory cell signaling pathways that favor scar formation over 
regrowth of endogenous neurons. Tissue engineering techniques, including the use 
of allografted neural networks, have shown promise for nervous system repair in 
prior studies. Through the use of a minimally invasive injury model in rats, we 
describe the implantation of micro-tissue engineered neural networks 
(micro-TENNs) across a region of SCI, spanning the glial scar to promote axonal 
regeneration. Forty-three female Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this 
study. Micro-TENNs were preformed in vitro before implant, and comprised rat 
sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons projecting long bundled axonal tracts 
within the lumen of a biocompatible hydrogel columnar encasement (1.2âcm long; 
701âÎ¼m outer diameterâÃâ300âÎ¼m inner diameter). Animals were injured using a 2F 
embolectomy catheter inflated within the epidural space. After a 2-week recovery 
period, micro-TENNs were stereotactically implanted across the injury. Animals 
were euthanized at 1 week and 1 month after implantation, and the tissue was 
interrogated for the survival of graft DRG neurons and outgrowth of axons. No 
intraoperative deaths were noted with implantation of the micro-TENNs to span 
the injury cavity. Graft DRG axons were found to survive at 1 week postimplant 
within the hydrogel encasement. Graft-derived axonal outgrowth was observed 
within the spinal cord up to 4.5âmm from the implant site at 1 month postinjury. 
Limited astroglial response was noted within the host, suggesting minimal trauma 
and scar formation in response to the graft. Micro-TENN sensory neurons survive 
and extend axons into the host spinal cord following a minimally invasive SCI in 
rats. This work serves as the foundation for future studies investigating the 
use of micro-TENNs as a living bridge to promote recovery following SCI. Impact 
statement As spinal cord injury pathology develops, the establishment of a glial 
scar puts an end to the hope of regeneration and recovery from the consequent 
neurological deficits. Therefore, growing attention is given to bioengineered 
scaffolds that can bridge the lesions bordered by this scar tissue. The 
utilization of longitudinally aligned preformed neural networks-referred to as 
micro-tissue engineered neural networks (TENNs)-presents a promising opportunity 
to provide a multipurpose bridging strategy that may take advantage of several 
potential mechanisms of host regeneration. In addition to providing physical 
support for regenerating spinal cord axons, micro-TENNs may serve as a 
functional "cable" that restores lost connections within the spinal cord.

Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly lethal and debilitating disease 
with a variety of etiologies. To date, there is no effective therapeutic 
modality for a complete cure. The pathological mechanisms of spinal cord injury 
at the molecular gene and protein expression levels remain unclear. Methods: 
This study used single-cell transcriptomic analysis and protein microarray 
analysis to analyzes changes in the gene expression profiles of cells and 
secretion of inflammatory factors respectively, around the lesion site in a rat 
SCI model. Results: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis found that three types 
of glial cells (microglia, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte) becomes activated 
after acute injury, with GO exhibiting a variety of inflammatory-related terms 
after injury, such as metabolic processes, immune regulation, and antigen 
presentation. Protein microarray results showed that the levels of four 
inflammatory cytokines favoring SCI repair decreased while the levels of nine 
inflammatory cytokines hindering SCI repair increased after injury. Conclusion: 
These findings thus reveal the changes in cellular state from homeostatic to 
reactive cell type after SCI, which contribute to understand the pathology 
process of SCI, and the potential relationship between glial cells and 
inflammatory factors after SCI, and provides new theoretical foundation for 
further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of secondary SCI.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral 
pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic. As of 19 May 2021, John Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking 
platform reported 3.3 million deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Currently, the World Health Organization has granted emergency use listing (EUL) 
to six COVID-19 vaccine candidates. However, much of the pathogenesis observed 
during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the 
contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in 
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse-genetics system 
approach to successfully engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) 
constructs; we removed individual viral ORF3a, -6, -7a, -7b, and -8 proteins 
from them, and we characterized the resulting recombinant viruses in vitro and 
in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with 
ORF-deficient (ÎORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild 
type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of ÎORF viruses were like those 
of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the ÎORF rSARS-CoV-2s identified ORF3a and 
ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while ÎORF7a, ÎORF7b, and 
ÎORF8 rSARS-CoV-2s induced pathology comparable to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This 
study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse-genetics system to generate 
rSARS-CoV-2 constructs and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral 
pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated 
forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live attenuated vaccines for the 
treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite 
great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights 
into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of viral proteins to 
disease outcome remain elusive. Our study aims (i) to determine the contribution 
of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins to viral pathogenesis 
and disease outcome and (ii) to develop a synergistic platform combining our 
robust reverse-genetics system to generate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 constructs 
with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrate that 
SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease 
outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little 
impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as a 
foundation for generating attenuated forms of the virus to develop live 
attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

A severe form of infantile cardiomyopathy (CM) has been linked to mutations in 
ELAC2, a highly conserved human gene. It encodes Zinc phosphodiesterase ELAC 
protein 2 (ELAC2), which plays an essential role in the production of mature 
tRNAs. To establish a causal connection between ELAC2 variants and CM, here we 
used the Drosophila melanogaster model organism, which carries the ELAC2 homolog 
RNaseZ. Even though RNaseZ and ELAC2 have diverged in some of their biological 
functions, our study demonstrates the use of the fly model to study the 
mechanism of ELAC2-related pathology. We established transgenic lines harboring 
RNaseZ with CM-linked mutations in the background of endogenous RNaseZ knockout. 
Importantly, we found that the phenotype of these flies is consistent with the 
pathological features in human patients. Specifically, expression of CM-linked 
variants in flies caused heart hypertrophy and led to reduction in cardiac 
contractility associated with a rare form of CM. This study provides first 
experimental evidence for the pathogenicity of CM-causing mutations in the ELAC2 
protein, and the foundation to improve our understanding and diagnosis of this 
rare infantile disease. This article has an associated First Person interview 
with the first author of the paper.

BACKGROUND: We developed and validated a prognostic and predictive computational 
pathology risk score (CoRiS) using H&E stained tissue images from patients with 
early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC).
METHODS: 1330 patients with ES-NSCLC were acquired from 3 independent sources 
and divided into four cohorts D1-4. D1 comprised 100 surgery treated patients 
and was used to identify prognostic features via an elastic-net Cox model to 
predict overall and disease-free survival. CoRiS was constructed using the Cox 
model coefficients for the top features. The prognostic performance of CoRiS was 
evaluated on D2 (N=331), D3 (N=657) and D4 (N=242). Patients from D2 and D3 
which comprised surgeryÂ +Â chemotherapy were used to validate CoRiS as predictive 
of added benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) by comparing survival between 
different CoRiS defined risk groups.
FINDINGS: CoRiS was found to be prognostic on univariable analysis, D2 (hazard 
ratio (HR)Â =Â 1.41, adjusted (adj.) PÂ =Â .01) and D3 (HRÂ =Â 1.35, adj. P < .001). 
Multivariable analysis showed CoRiS was independently prognostic, D2 (HRÂ =Â 1.41, 
adj. P < .001) and D3 (HRÂ =Â 1.35, adj. P < .001), after adjusting for 
clinico-pathologic factors. CoRiS was also able to identify high-risk patients 
who derived survival benefit from ACT D2 (HRÂ =Â 0.42, adj. PÂ =Â .006) and D3 
(HRÂ =Â 0.46, adj. PÂ =Â .08).
INTERPRETATION: CoRiS is a tissue non-destructive, quantitative and low-cost 
tool that could potentially help guide management of ES-NSCLC patients.

Annie Mayer Bridwell works in the field of tuberculosis pathogenesis from the 
host perspective. She is fascinated by comorbidities, and in this paper, she 
reflects on three publications that shaped her model of neutrophil-centric 
pathology in tuberculosis and type 2 diabetes comorbidity. She explains that 
"Systems immunology of diabetes-tuberculosis comorbidity reveals signatures of 
disease complications" (C. A. Prada-Medina, K. F. Fukutani, N. Pavan Kumar, L. 
Gil-Santana, et al., Sci Rep 7:1999, 2017, 
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01767-4) led her to consider neutrophils as a 
central immunological player in comorbid patients. "Type I IFN exacerbates 
disease in tuberculosis-susceptible mice by inducing neutrophil-mediated lung 
inflammation and NETosis" (L. Moreira-Teixeira, P. J. Stimpson, E. Stavropoulos, 
S. Hadebe, et al., Nat Commun 11:5566, 2020, 
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19412-6) and "Diabetes primes neutrophils to 
undergo NETosis, which impairs wound healing" (S. L. Wong, M. Demers, K. 
Martinod, M. Gallant, et al., Nat Med 21:815-819, 2015, 
https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3887) then shed light on neutrophil extracellular 
trap (NET) formation as a common pathological feature of dysregulated 
neutrophils in tuberculosis and diabetes, respectively. Together, these works 
laid the foundation for Dr. Mayer Bridwell's interest in metabolic regulation of 
NETosis during TB infection and diabetes comorbidity.

Ocular inflammation imposes a high medical burden on patients and substantial 
costs on the health-care systems that mange these often chronic and debilitating 
diseases. Many clinical phenotypes are recognized and classifying the severity 
of inflammation in an eye with uveitis is an ongoing challenge. With the 
widespread application of optical coherence tomography in the clinic has come 
the impetus for more robust methods to compare disease between different 
patients and different treatment centers. Models can recapitulate many of the 
features seen in the clinic, but until recently the quality of imaging available 
has lagged that applied in humans. In the model experimental autoimmune uveitis 
(EAU), we highlight three linked clinical states that produce retinal 
vulnerability to inflammation, all different from healthy tissue, but distinct 
from each other. Deploying longitudinal, multimodal imaging approaches can be 
coupled to analysis in the tissue of changes in architecture, cell content and 
function. This can enrich our understanding of pathology, increase the 
sensitivity with which the impacts of therapeutic interventions are assessed and 
address questions of tissue regeneration and repair. Modern image processing, 
including the application of artificial intelligence, in the context of such 
models of disease can lay a foundation for new approaches to monitoring tissue 
health.

BACKGROUND: Nucleic acids are potent stimulators of type I interferon (IFN-I) 
and antiviral defense, but may also promote pathological inflammation. A range 
of diseases are characterized by elevated IFN-I, including systemic lupus 
erythematosus (lupus). The DNA-activated cGAS-STING pathway is a major 
IFN-I-inducing pathway, and activation of signaling is dependent on trafficking 
of STING from the ER to the Golgi.
METHODS: Here we used cell culture systems, a mouse lupus model, and material 
from lupus patients, to explore the mode of action of a STING antagonistic 
peptide, and its ability to modulate disease processes.
FINDINGS: We report that the peptide ISD017 selectively inhibits all known 
down-stream activities of STING, including IFN-I, inflammatory cytokines, 
autophagy, and apoptosis. ISD017 blocks the essential trafficking of STING from 
the ER to Golgi through a mechanism dependent on the STING ER retention factor 
STIM1. Importantly, ISD017 blocks STING activity in vivo and ameliorates disease 
development in a mouse model for lupus. Finally, ISD017 treatment blocks 
pathological cytokine responses in cells from lupus patients with elevated IFN-I 
levels.
INTERPRETATION: These data hold promise for beneficial use of STING-targeting 
therapy in lupus.

Objective: Ischemic heart disease accounts for over 20% of all deaths worldwide. 
As the global population faces a rising burden of chronic diseases, such as 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, the prevalence of heart failure due 
to ischemic heart disease is estimated to increase. We sought to develop a model 
that may more accurately identify therapeutic targets to mitigate the 
development of heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). Approach: 
Having utilized fetal large mammalian models of scarless wound healing, we 
proposed a fetal ovine model of myocardial regeneration after MI. Results: Use 
of this model has identified critical pathways in the mammalian response to MI, 
which are differentially activated in the regenerative, fetal mammalian response 
to MI when compared to the reparative, scar-forming, adult mammalian response to 
MI. Innovation: While the foundation of myocardial regeneration research has 
been built on zebrafish and rodent models, effective therapies derived from 
these disease models have been lacking; therefore, we sought to develop a more 
representative ovine model of myocardial regeneration after MI to improve the 
identification of therapeutic targets designed to mitigate the development of 
heart failure following MI. Conclusions: To develop therapies aimed at 
mitigating this rising burden of disease, it is critical that the animal models 
we utilize closely reflect the physiology and pathology we observe in human 
disease. We encourage use of this ovine large mammalian model to facilitate 
identification of therapies designed to mitigate the growing burden of heart 
failure.

Angiogenesis plays an important role in damaged organ or tissue and cell 
regeneration and ovarian development and function. Primary ovarian insufficiency 
(POI) is a prevalent pathology in women under 40. Conventional treatment for POI 
involves hormone therapy. However, due to its side effects, an alternative 
approach is desirable. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various sources 
restore ovarian function; however, they have many limitations as stem cell 
sources. Therefore, it is desirable to study the efficacy of placenta-derived 
MSCs (PD-MSCs), which possess many advantages over other MSCs, in a rat model of 
ovarian dysfunction. Here, we investigated the restorative effect of PD-MSCs on 
injured ovaries in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and the ability of intravenous 
transplantation (Tx) of PD-MSCs (5âÃâ105) to enhance ovarian vasculature and 
follicular development. ELISA analysis of serum revealed that compared to the 
non-transplantation (NTx) group, the Tx group showed significantly increased 
levels of anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and estradiol 
(E2) (*Pâ<â0.05). In addition, histological analysis showed more mature 
follicles and less atresia and restoration of expanded blood vessels in the 
ovaries of the OVX PD-MSC Tx group than those of the NTx group (*Pâ<â0.05). 
Furthermore, folliculogenesis-related gene expression was also significantly 
increased in the PD-MSC Tx group (*Pâ<â0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 expressions were increased in the ovaries of the OVX 
PD-MSC Tx group compared to the NTx group through PI3K/AKT/mTOR and 
GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin pathway activation. Interestingly, ex vivo cocultivation of 
damaged ovaries and PD-MSCs or treatment with recombinant VEGF (50âng/ml) 
increased folliculogenic factors and VEGF signaling pathways. Notably, compared 
to recombinant VEGF, PD-MSCs significantly increased folliculogenesis and 
angiogenesis (*Pâ<â0.05). These findings suggest that VEGF secreted by PD-MSCs 
promotes follicular development and ovarian function after OVX through vascular 
remodeling. Therefore, these results provide fundamental data for understanding 
the therapeutic effects and mechanism of stem cell therapy based on PD-MSCs and 
provide a theoretical foundation for their application for obstetrical and 
gynecological diseases, including infertility and menopause.

Cardiac macrophages are known from various activities, therefore we presume that 
microRNAs (miRNAs) produced or released by macrophages in cardiac tissue have 
impact on myocardial remodeling in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS). 
We aim to assess the cardiac macrophage miRNA profile by selecting those miRNA 
molecules that potentially exhibit regulatory functions in MetS-related cardiac 
remodeling. Cardiac tissue macrophages from control and db/db mice (an animal 
model of MetS) were counted and sorted with flow cytometry, which yielded two 
populations: CD45+CD11b+CD64+Ly6Chi and CD45+CD11b+CD64+Ly6Clow. Total RNA was 
then isolated, and miRNA expression profiles were evaluated with Next Generation 
Sequencing. We successfully sequenced 1400 miRNAs in both macrophage 
populations: CD45+CD11b+CD64+Ly6Chi and CD45+CD11b+CD64+Ly6Clow. Among the 1400 
miRNAs, about 150 showed different expression levels in control and db/db mice 
and between these two subpopulations. At least 15 miRNAs are possibly associated 
with MetS pathology in cardiac tissue due to direct or indirect regulation of 
the expression of miRNAs for proteins involved in angiogenesis, fibrosis, or 
inflammation. In this paper, for the first time we describe the miRNA 
transcription profile in two distinct macrophage populations in MetS-affected 
cardiac tissue. Although the results are preliminary, the presented data provide 
a foundation for further studies on intercellular cross-talk/molecular

In this study, we take an important step toward clinical translation by 
generating the first canine-induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). We explore key 
aspects of scale-up, persistence, and safety of personalized iNSC therapy in 
autologous canine surgery models. iNSCs are a promising new approach to treat 
aggressive cancers of the brain, including the deadly glioblastoma. Created by 
direct transdifferentiation of fibroblasts, iNSCs are known to migrate through 
the brain, track down invasive cancer foci, and deliver anticancer payloads that 
significantly reduce tumor burden and extend survival of tumor-bearing mice. 
Here, skin biopsies were collected from canines and converted into the first 
personalized canine iNSCs engineered to carry TNFÎ±-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand (TRAIL) and thymidine kinase (TK), as well as magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) contrast agents for in vivo tracking. Time-lapse analysis showed canine 
iNSCs efficiently migrate to human tumor cells, and cell viability assays showed 
both TRAIL and TK monotherapy markedly reduced tumor growth. Using 
intraoperative navigation and two delivery methods to closely mimic human 
therapy, canines received autologous iNSCs either within postsurgical cavities 
in a biocompatible matrix or via a catheter placed in the lateral ventricle. 
Both strategies were well tolerated, and serial MRI showed hypointense regions 
at the implant sites that remained stable through 86âdays postimplant. Serial 
fluid sample testing following iNSC delivery showed the bimodal personalized 
therapy was well tolerated, with no iNSC-induced abnormal tissue pathology. 
Overall, this study lays an important foundation as this promising personalized 
cell therapy advances toward human patient testing.

BACKGROUND: The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) is an 
important part of China's innovation system. In the last decade, the pig has 
become more and more widely used in the field of medical science, especially in 
otology research.
OBJECTIVE: By analyzing and summarizing the funding information over recent 
years, we intend to identify the characteristics and trends of funding for 
research using pig models and provide references for future development.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a comprehensive analysis of features in funding 
for research projects involving pig models by the NSFC in the past 10 years, 
with a focus on projects in the field of otolaryngology/head and neck surgery.
RESULTS: Both the number and amount of funding provided by the NSFC for research 
involving pig models are on the rise with each passing year. Researchers at the 
PLA General Hospital have completed a number of studies using miniature pigs in 
cochlear morphology, electrophysiology, cochlear implantation, cochlear 
transcription analysis, gene therapy, inner ear disease modeling and Eustachian 
tube pathology modeling.
CONCLUSION: Pigs as an ideal large mammal model are well suited in the current 
national basic research strategy in China, and can help further strengthen 
China's leading position in basic research in the world.

BACKGROUND: The chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is an extremely high risk genetic 
factor for various neuropsychiatric disorders; however, the 22q11.2 
deletion-related brain pathology in humans at the cellular and molecular levels 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We generated iPS cells from healthy controls (control group) and 
patients with 22q11.2 deletion (22DS group), and differentiated them into 
dopaminergic neurons. Semiquantitative proteomic analysis was performed to 
compare the two groups. Next, we conducted molecular, cell biological and 
pharmacological assays.
FINDINGS: Semiquantitative proteomic analysis identified 'protein processing in 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)' as the most altered pathway in the 22DS group. 
In particular, we found a severe defect in protein kinase R-like endoplasmic 
reticulum kinase (PERK) expression and its activity in the 22DS group. The 
decreased PERK expression was also shown in the midbrain of a 22q11.2 deletion 
mouse model. The 22DS group showed characteristic phenotypes, including poor 
tolerance to ER stress, abnormal F-actin dynamics, and decrease in protein 
synthesis. Some of phenotypes were rescued by the pharmacological manipulation 
of PERK activity and phenocopied in PERK-deficient dopaminergic neurons. We 
lastly showed that DGCR14 was associated with reduction in PERK expression.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings led us to conclude that the 22q11.2 deletion causes 
various vulnerabilities in dopaminergic neurons, dependent on PERK dysfunction.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) increases the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
However, there are few tools to detect microstructural changes after AKI. Here, 
cationic ferritin-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CFE-MRI) was applied to 
examine the heterogeneity of kidney pathology in the transition from AKI to CKD. 
Adult male mice received folic acid followed by cationic ferritin and were 
euthanized at four days (AKI), four weeks (CKD-4) or 12 weeks (CKD-12). Kidneys 
were examined by histologic methods and CFE-MRI. In the CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups, 
glomerular number was reduced and atubular cortical lesions were observed. 
Apparent glomerular volume was larger in the AKI, CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups 
compared to controls. Glomerular hypertrophy occurred with ageing. 
Interglomerular distance and glomerular density were combined with other MRI 
metrics to distinguish the AKI and CKD groups from controls. Despite significant 
heterogeneity, the noninvasive (MRI-based) metrics were as accurate as invasive 
(histological) metrics at distinguishing AKI and CKD from controls. To assess 
the toxicity of cationic ferritin in a CKD model, CKD-4 mice received cationic 
ferritin and were examined one week later. The CKD-4 groups with and without 
cationic ferritin were similar, except the iron content of the kidney, liver, 
and spleen was greater in the CKD-4 plus cationic ferritin group. Thus, our 
study demonstrates the accuracy and safety of CFE-MRI to detect whole kidney 
pathology allowing for the development of novel biomarkers of kidney disease and 
providing a foundation for future inÂ vivo longitudinal studies in mouse models 
of AKI and CKD to track nephron fate.

OBJECTIVE: Telerehabilitation has long been recognized as a promising means of 
providing pediatric services; however, significant barriers such as cost, payor 
reimbursement, and access prevented widespread use. The advent of the COVID-19 
pandemic necessitated rapid adoption of telerehabilitation into clinical 
practice to provide access to care while maintaining social distancing. The 
purpose of this study is to present clinical data on the feasibility and 
acceptability of speech-language pathology, developmental occupational and 
physical therapies, and sports and orthopedic therapies telerehabilitation 
delivered in a pediatric hospital setting.
METHODS: Telerehabilitation services were rapidly implemented in three stages: 
building the foundation, implementing, and refining this service delivery model. 
Paper patient satisfaction surveys were administered as part of ongoing quality 
improvement efforts throughout 2019 and were adapted for online administration 
in 2020 for telerehabilitation patients. Outpatient visit counts by type 
(in-person, phone, and video) were extracted from the electronic medical record 
using data warehousing techniques.
RESULTS: Historical patient satisfaction rates from 2019 indicated high patient 
satisfaction (98.97% positive responses); these results were maintained for 
telerehabilitation visits (97.73%), indicating that families found 
telerehabilitation services acceptable. Patient volume returned to 73.5% of 
pre-pandemic volume after the implementation of telerehabilitation services.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric telerehabilitation is feasible to provide in clinical 
settings, and the services are acceptable to patient families. Future work is 
needed to evaluate the impact of telerehabilitation services on patient care and 
applications for ongoing use of this delivery model.

BACKGROUND: To develop a deep learning model to classify primary bone tumors 
from preoperative radiographs and compare performance with radiologists.
METHODS: A total of 1356 patients (2899 images) with histologically confirmed 
primary bone tumors and pre-operative radiographs were identified from five 
institutions' pathology databases. Manual cropping was performed by radiologists 
to label the lesions. Binary discriminatory capacity (benign versus not-benign 
and malignant versus not-malignant) and three-way classification (benign versus 
intermediate versus malignant) performance of our model were evaluated. The 
generalizability of our model was investigated on data from external test set. 
Final model performance was compared with interpretation from five radiologists 
of varying level of experience using the Permutations tests.
FINDINGS: For benign vs. not benign, model achieved area under curve (AUC) of 
0â¢894 and 0â¢877 on cross-validation and external testing, respectively. For 
malignant vs. not malignant, model achieved AUC of 0â¢907 and 0â¢916 on 
cross-validation and external testing, respectively. For three-way 
classification, model achieved 72â¢1% accuracy vs. 74â¢6% and 72â¢1% for the two 
subspecialists on cross-validation (pÂ =Â 0â¢03 and pÂ =Â 0â¢52, respectively). On 
external testing, model achieved 73â¢4% accuracy vs. 69â¢3%, 73â¢4%, 73â¢1%, 67â¢9%, 
and 63â¢4% for the two subspecialists and three junior radiologists (pÂ =Â 0â¢14, 
pÂ =Â 0â¢89, pÂ =Â 0â¢93, pÂ =Â 0â¢02, pÂ <Â 0â¢01 for radiologists 1-5, respectively).
INTERPRETATION: Deep learning can classify primary bone tumors using 
conventional radiographs in a multi-institutional dataset with similar accuracy 
compared to subspecialists, and better performance than junior radiologists.

BACKGROUND: Classification of diseases based on genetic information is of great 
significance as the basis for precision medicine, increasing the understanding 
of disease etiology and revolutionizing personalized medicine. Much effort has 
been directed at understanding disease associations by constructing disease 
networks, and classifying patient samples according to gene expression data. 
Integrating human gene networks overcomes limited coverage of genes. 
Incorporating pathway information into disease classification procedure 
addresses the challenge of cellular heterogeneity across patients.
RESULTS: In this work, we propose a disease classification model LAMP, which 
concentrates on the layered assessment on modules and pathways. Directed human 
gene interactions are the foundation of constructing the human gene network, 
where the significant roles of disease and pathway genes are recognized. The 
fast unfolding algorithm identifies 11 modules in the largest connected 
component. Then layered networks are introduced to distinguish positions of 
genes in propagating information from sources to targets. After gene screening, 
hierarchical clustering and refined process, 1726 diseases from KEGG are 
classified into 18 categories. Also, it is expounded that diseases with 
overlapping genes may not belong to the same category in LAMP. Within each 
category, entropy is applied to measure the compositional complexity, and to 
evaluate the prospects for combination diagnosis and gene-targeted therapy for 
diseases.
CONCLUSION: In this work, by collecting data from BioGRID and KEGG, we develop a 
disease classification model LAMP, to support people to view diseases from the 
perspective of commonalities in etiology and pathology. Comprehensive research 
on existing diseases can help meet the challenges of unknown diseases. The 
results provide suggestions for combination diagnosis and gene-targeted therapy, 
which motivates clinicians and researchers to reposition the understanding of 
diseases and explore diagnosis and therapy strategies.

Cobalamin deficiency affects human physiology with sequelae ranging from mild 
fatigue to severe neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The cellular and molecular 
aspects of the nervous system disorders associated with hypovitaminosis B12 
remain largely unknown. Growing evidence indicates that astrogliosis is an 
underlying component of a wide range of neuropathologies. Previously, we 
developed an in vitro model of cobalamin deficiency in normal human astrocytes 
(NHA) by culturing the cells with c-lactam of hydroxycobalamin (c-lactam 
OH-Cbl). We revealed a non-apoptotic activation of caspases (3/7, 8, 9) in 
cobalamin-deficient NHA, which may suggest astrogliosis. The aim of the current 
study was to experimentally verify this hypothesis. We indicated an increase in 
the cellular expression of two astrogliosis markers: glial fibrillary acidic 
protein and vimentin in cobalamin-deficient NHA using Western blot analysis and 
immunocytochemistry with confocal laser scanning microscopy. In the next step of 
the study, we revealed c-lactam OH-Cbl as a potential non-toxic vitamin B12 
antagonist in an in vivo model using zebrafish embryos. We believe that the 
presented results will contribute to a better understanding of the cellular 
mechanism underlying neurologic pathology due to cobalamin deficiency and will 
serve as a foundation for further studies.

Introduction: Arterial brain vessel assessment is crucial for the diagnostic 
process in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Non-invasive neuroimaging 
techniques, such as time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) 
imaging are applied in the clinical routine to depict arteries. They are, 
however, only visually assessed. Fully automated vessel segmentation integrated 
into the clinical routine could facilitate the time-critical diagnosis of vessel 
abnormalities and might facilitate the identification of valuable biomarkers for 
cerebrovascular events. In the present work, we developed and validated a new 
deep learning model for vessel segmentation, coined BRAVE-NET, on a large 
aggregated dataset of patients with cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: BRAVE-NET 
is a multiscale 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed on a 
dataset of 264 patients from three different studies enrolling patients with 
cerebrovascular diseases. A context path, dually capturing high- and 
low-resolution volumes, and deep supervision were implemented. The BRAVE-NET 
model was compared to a baseline Unet model and variants with only context paths 
and deep supervision, respectively. The models were developed and validated 
using high-quality manual labels as ground truth. Next to precision and recall, 
the performance was assessed quantitatively by Dice coefficient (DSC); average 
Hausdorff distance (AVD); 95-percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD); and via 
visual qualitative rating. Results: The BRAVE-NET performance surpassed the 
other models for arterial brain vessel segmentation with a DSC = 0.931, AVD = 
0.165, and 95HD = 29.153. The BRAVE-NET model was also the most resistant toward 
false labelings as revealed by the visual analysis. The performance improvement 
is primarily attributed to the integration of the multiscaling context path into 
the 3-D Unet and to a lesser extent to the deep supervision architectural 
component. Discussion: We present a new state-of-the-art of arterial brain 
vessel segmentation tailored to cerebrovascular pathology. We provide an 
extensive experimental validation of the model using a large aggregated dataset 
encompassing a large variability of cerebrovascular disease and an external set 
of healthy volunteers. The framework provides the technological foundation for 
improving the clinical workflow and can serve as a biomarker extraction tool in 
cerebrovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain metastases originating from gynaecological tumours 
are a rare phenomenon, but have an increasing incidence due to better targeted 
therapies. This study aimed to identify factors that predict survival in these 
patients, which can be used in creating a robust prognostic tool for shared 
decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a consecutive cohort of 73 patients treated 
for gynaecological brain metastases in two tertiary institutions. Baseline 
demographics, pathology and serum CA-125 were included in a multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Median overall survival in our cohort was 14.4â¯months, with a one-year 
survival of 56.4% and a two-year survival of 39.1%. Thirty-eight patients 
(52.1%) had ovarian carcinoma as the primary malignancy. The following factors 
were significantly associated with survival: age (HR 1.05 per year), CA-125 (HR 
1.02 par 50â¯U/ml), and uterine and vulvar primary tumours (when compared to 
ovarian carcinoma, with HRs 3.07 and 8.70). A post-hoc analysis with primary 
tumour site reclassified into ovary versus non-ovary showed a HR of 0.50 for 
ovarian primary tumour type.
CONCLUSION: We have found that age, pathology and CA-125 are prognostic factors 
for survival in patients with brain metastases from gynaecological tumours. Our 
findings may provide a foundation for future development of prediction models, 
for the benefit of both patients and physicians.

BACKGROUND: Delay in identifying deterioration in hospitalised patients is 
associated with delayed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and poor 
outcomes. For the HAVEN project (HICF ref.: HICF-R9-524), we have developed a 
mathematical model that identifies deterioration in hospitalised patients in 
real time and facilitates the intervention of an ICU outreach team. This paper 
describes the system that has been designed to implement the model. We have used 
innovative technologies such as Portable Format for Analytics (PFA) and Open 
Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) to define the predictive statistical model 
and implement the system respectively for greater configurability, reliability, 
and availability.
RESULTS: The HAVEN system has been deployed as part of a research project in the 
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The system has so far 
processed >â164,000 vital signs observations andâ>â68,000 laboratory results for 
>â12,500 patients and the algorithm generated score is being evaluated to review 
patients who are under consideration for transfer to ICU. No clinical decisions 
are being made based on output from the system. The HAVEN score has been 
computed using a PFA model for all these patients. The intent is that this score 
will be displayed on a graphical user interface for clinician review and 
response.
CONCLUSIONS: The system uses a configurable PFA model to compute the HAVEN score 
which makes the system easily upgradable in terms of enhancing systems' 
predictive capability. Further system enhancements are planned to handle new 
data sources and additional management screens.

Automatic Assessment of Language Ability in Children with and without Typical 
Development.

Gale R, Dolata J, Prud'hommeaux E, van Santen J, Asgari M.

This study describes a fully automated method of expressive language assessment 
based on vocal responses of children to a sentence repetition task (SRT), a 
language test that taps into core language skills. Our proposed method 
automatically transcribes the vocal responses using a test-specific automatic 
speech recognition system. From the transcriptions, a regression model predicts 
the gold standard test scores provided by speech-language pathologists. Our 
preliminary experimental results on audio recordings of 104 children (43 with 
typical development and 61 with a neurodevelopmental disorder) verifies the 
feasibility of the proposed automatic method for predicting gold standard scores 
on this language test, with averaged mean absolute error of 6.52 (on a observed 
score range from 0 to 90 with a mean value of 49.56) between observed and 
predicted ratings.Clinical relevance-We describe the use of fully automatic 
voice-based scoring in language assessment including the clinical impact this 
development may have on the field of speech-language pathology. The automated 
test also creates a technological foundation for the computerization of a broad 
array of tests for voice-based language assessment.

Amacrine cells (ACs) are a diverse class of interneurons that modulate input 
from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), rendering each RGC type 
selectively sensitive to particular visual features, which are then relayed to 
the brain. While many AC types have been identified morphologically and 
physiologically, they have not been comprehensively classified or molecularly 
characterized. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to profile 
>32,000 ACs from mice of both sexes and applied computational methods to 
identify 63 AC types. We identified molecular markers for each type and used 
them to characterize the morphology of multiple types. We show that they include 
nearly all previously known AC types as well as many that had not been 
described. Consistent with previous studies, most of the AC types expressed 
markers for the canonical inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA or glycine, but 
several expressed neither or both. In addition, many expressed one or more 
neuropeptides, and two expressed glutamatergic markers. We also explored 
transcriptomic relationships among AC types and identified transcription factors 
expressed by individual or multiple closely related types. Noteworthy among 
these were Meis2 and Tcf4, expressed by most GABAergic and most glycinergic 
types, respectively. Together, these results provide a foundation for 
developmental and functional studies of ACs, as well as means for genetically 
accessing them. Along with previous molecular, physiological, and morphologic 
analyses, they establish the existence of at least 130 neuronal types and nearly 
140 cell types in the mouse retina.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mouse retina is a 
leading model for analyzing the development, structure, function, and pathology 
of neural circuits. A complete molecular atlas of retinal cell types provides an 
important foundation for these studies. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA 
sequencing to characterize the most heterogeneous class of retinal interneurons, 
amacrine cells, identifying 63 distinct types. The atlas includes types 
identified previously as well as many novel types. We provide evidence for the 
use of multiple neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and identify transcription 
factors expressed by groups of closely related types. Combining these results 
with those obtained previously, we proposed that the mouse retina contains â¼130 
neuronal types and is therefore comparable in complexity to other regions of the 
brain.

Huntington's disease (HD) patients suffer from progressive and debilitating 
motor dysfunction for which only palliative treatment is currently available. 
Previously, we discovered reduced skeletal muscle Cl- channel (ClC-1) and 
inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir) currents in R6/2 HD transgenic mice. To 
further investigate the role of ClC-1 and Kir currents in HD skeletal muscle 
pathology, we measured the effect of reduced ClC-1 and Kir currents on action 
potential (AP) repetitive firing in R6/2 mice using a two-electrode current 
clamp. We found that R6/2 APs had a significantly lower peak amplitude, 
depolarized maximum repolarization, and prolonged decay time compared with wild 
type (WT). Of these differences, only the maximum repolarization was accounted 
for by the reduction in ClC-1 and Kir currents, indicating the presence of 
additional ion channel defects. We found that both KV1.5 and KV3.4 mRNA levels 
were significantly reduced in R6/2 skeletal muscle compared with WT, which 
explains the prolonged decay time of R6/2 APs. Overall, we found that APs in WT 
and R6/2 muscle significantly and progressively change during activity to 
maintain peak amplitude despite buildup of Na+ channel inactivation. Even with 
this resilience, the persistently reduced peak amplitude of R6/2 APs is expected 
to result in earlier fatigue and may help explain the motor impersistence 
experienced by HD patients. This work lays the foundation to link electrical 
changes to force generation defects in R6/2 HD mice and to examine the 
regulatory events controlling APs in WT muscle.

Background and Objectives: There are currently no data available regarding 
pediatric scoliosis surgery in Latvia. The aim of this article is to present 
treatment specific variables, investigate their interrelation, and identify 
predictors for the length of stay after surgical pediatric scoliosis correction. 
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included all surgical pediatric 
scoliosis corrections in Latvia for the years 2012 to 2016. Analyzed parameters 
were chosen to portray the patients' demographics, pathology, as well as 
treatment specific variables. Descriptive, inferential, and linear regression 
statistics were calculated. Results: A total of 69 cases, 74% female and 26% 
male, were identified. The diagnostic subgroups consisted of 62% idiopathic 
(IDI) and 38% non-idiopathic (non-IDI) scoliosis cases. Non-IDI cases had 
significantly increased operation time, hospital stay, Cobb angle before 
surgery, and instrumented levels, while IDI cases showed significantly higher 
Cobb angle percentage correction. For all operated cases, the operation time and 
the hospital stay decreased significantly over the investigated time period. 
Early post-operative complications (PCs) occurred in 15.9% of the cases and were 
associated with increased hospital stay, instrumented levels, and Cobb angle 
before surgery. The linear regression analysis revealed that operation time and 
the presence of PCs were significant predictors for the length of the hospital 
stay. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide comprehensive insight into 
pediatric scoliosis surgery since its establishment in Latvia. Our regression 
model offers clinically applicable predictors and further underlines the 
significance of the operation length on the hospital stay. These results build 
the foundation for international comparison and facilitate improvement in the 
field.

Personality pathology often emerges during adolescence, but attempts to 
understand its neurocognitive basis have traditionally been undermined by 
problems associated with the categorical classification of personality 
disorders. In contrast, dimensional models of personality pathology, such as the 
Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) in DSM-5, may provide a 
stronger foundation for neurobiological investigations of maladaptive individual 
differences in personality. As an example, we review studies of the adolescent 
development of reward processing and cognitive control and connect these systems 
to the normal personality hierarchy and to two dimensions included in the AMPD - 
Detachment and Disinhibition. We argue that by linking developmental changes in 
these systems to the AMPD, researchers will be better positioned to understand 
the relationship between neurocognitive development and the expression of 
personality pathology in adolescence and early adulthood.

Kidney tubules are lined with flow-sensing structures, yet information about the 
flow itself is not easily obtained. We aim to generate a multiscale 
biomechanical model for analyzing fluid flow and fluid-structure interactions 
within an elastic kidney tubule when the driving pressure is pulsatile. We 
developed a two-dimensional macroscopic mathematical model of a single 
fluid-filled tubule corresponding to a distal nephron segment and determined 
both flow dynamics and wall strains over a range of driving frequencies and wall 
compliances using finite-element analysis. The results presented here 
demonstrate good agreement with available analytical solutions and form a 
foundation for future inclusion of elastohydrodynamic coupling by neighboring 
tubules. Overall, we are interested in exploring the idea of dynamic pathology 
to better understand the progression of chronic kidney diseases such as 
Polycystic Kidney Disease.
