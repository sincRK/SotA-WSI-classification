Cells with centroblast and centrocytic morphology are identified in the central part of the folliculo-like structures. The number of centroblasts exceeds 15 per high-power field (x40) when counted in 10 different fields in 10 different folliculo-like structures.  Cells in the central part of the folliculo-like structures express CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6. The folliculo-like structures have a framework of CD23+ follicular dendritic cells. The proliferation index (Ki-67) reaches 50%. CD3 and CD5 are expressed predominantly by cells in the interfollicular zones (to a lesser extent by T cells in the central part of the pseudofollicles). Numerous CD23+ cells are also identified in the interfollicular zones, some of which are mantle cells. Co-expression of CD23 by tumor cells cannot be ruled out.

MUM1 expression is determined primarily in the nuclei of plasma cells. The number of CD30+ cells in the interfollicular zones is slightly increased. No convincing signs of restriction of light chain immunoglobulin expression were detected. Numerous epithelioid histiocytes are determined in the interfollicular zones, forming small clusters penetrating, including the hyperplastic follicles. Around the periphery of the mantle zones of many hyperplastic follicles, rimming clusters of large cells with abundant cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with 1-2 nucleoli, located both near the nuclear membrane and centrally, are determined.
